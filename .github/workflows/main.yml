# This action from https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action
#
# This deploy action needs to be used instead of the usual GitHub
# pages pipeline, because that only allows a whitelisted set of Ruby
# Gems, and no custom code for plugins. See [1]
#
#
# As we want to have some custom code for creating embed frames and
# suchlike, we need to use this alternative.  See [2]
#
# Notes:
# - This uses the GITHUB_TOKEN secret created for the workflow automatically
#   by GitHub Actions. No custom Personal Access Token is needed,
#   at the time of writing. See the jekyll-deploy-action repo for more information.
