# Rushkoff Archive

This repository contains code to extract the posts stored at
https://api.archive.rushkoff.com/.  Nothing very clever here. Requires
Ruby 2.x or later.

There is currently a dump of the posts in YAML format under
[posts/](./posts), for inspection. This may serve as a basis for
static site generation later.
