Thinking about machines that think may constitute a classic reversal of figure and ground, medium and message. It sets us up to think about the next stage of intelligence as something happening in a computer somewhere--an awareness that will be born and then housed on the tremendous servers being built by Information Age corporations for this purpose. "There it is," we'll declare, and point: "The intelligent machine."

Our mistake, as creatures of the Electronic Age and mere

immigrants to an unfolding Digital Era, is to see digital tech-

nology as a subject rather than a landscape. It's the same as con-

fusing the television set with the media environment created by

the television set, or the little smartphone in your pocket with

the greater impact of handheld communications and comput-

ing technology on our society.

This happens whenever we undergo a media transition. So

we can't help but see digital technology as figure, when it's

actually the ground. It's not the source of future intelligence

but an environment where intelligence manifests differently.

So while technologists may feel as though they're creating a

cathedral for the mechanical mind, they're actually succumb-

ing to an oversimplified Industrial Age approach to digital con-

sc10usness.

Rather than toward machines that think, I believe we're

migrating toward a networked environment in which think-

ing is no longer an individual activity nor bound by time al1cl

space. This means we can think together at the · same time, or

asynchronously through digital representations of previous and

future human thoughts. Even the most advanced algorithm

amounts to the iteration of a "what if" once posed by a person.

And even then, machine thinking isn't something that happens

apart from this collective human thinking, because it's not a

localized, brain-like activity.

When we can wrest that television-like image from our c_ol-

lective psyche, we'll be in a position to_rec_ognize t:e m:c!:\~\~ . . hich we're already thmkmg toget er.
