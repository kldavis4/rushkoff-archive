Back in the late 1990s, I became interested in the potential of interactive and networking technologies to enhance the potential for democratic and civic participation. I wrote a short book entitled _Open Source Democracy_ (Rushkoff 1998) in which I outlined what I saw as the opportunity for deeper levels of public intervention not just in electoral politics, but in ongoing civic affairs.

At the time most visions of electronically enabled democracy were still stuck in what we might call the Ross Perot phase: use the net to let people vote or participate in what the third-party presidential candidate called "electronic town halls" (Simon 1992). Perot envisioned citizens watching television programs that informed them about the issues and then voting yes or no to proposals through their remote controls.

Meanwhile, Clinton pollster Dick Morris (Martinson 2000; Morris 2000) saw in the Internet a new path to polling accuracy. Instead of calling people and asking them questions, Internet pollsters could send e-mails and monitor existing discussion groups and comments sections. While feedback from users would not directly influence policy, at least lawmakers would be able to gauge (and presumably change messaging in order to influence) public opinion.

My own hope was for a deeper level of participation. Just as the Internet allowed former television viewers to create something very much like programming, the Internet could allow former voters to create something very much like policy platforms. The law might come to resemble less a set of bound volumes than a participatory wiki.

The 2004 Howard Dean campaign was among the first to respond to this call for a more net-enabled democracy. Dean's campaign manager, Joe Trippi, used the language of open source democracy to energize the first sustained and successful Internet political fund-raising campaign. Instead of taking large sums from a small group of donors, Dean drew support from thousands upon thousands of individuals whose donations averaged just $80. Nevertheless, the $50 million that Dean raised made him the first presidential candidate to forgo federal matching funds (Trippi 2004).

Eventually, the Obama campaign followed suit, using Facebook, Twitter, Meetup, forums, and a state-of-the-art Web site to solicit campaign donations, organize on-the-ground get-out-the-vote activities, and generate peer-to-peer support for his candidacy. He, too, raised enough money to reject federal campaign funds and managed to leverage the Internet's metaphorical value as a participatory medium to cast his candidacy as a bottom-up people's revolution.

However, after Obama won, the stirring idea that “we are the change we have been waiting for" quickly devolved into politics as usual. While Obama the net-enabled campaigner offered many ways for people to get involved by donating money or getting others to donate money, Obama the net-enabled office holder used the net much less aggressively. The administration offers greater transparency than its predecessors, making it easier for citizens to find pending legislation on the Web. But for the most part, it is still a read-only government. The net was used to gather the troops for the campaign, but not to solicit or enable their participation as citizens in an ongoing way. For those who may have risen to the call to "be the change" (Sullivan 2008), this was a disappointment.

But the media attention garnered through YouTube-sponsored debates and national net-organized Meetups spurred dozens of pop culture and commercial copycats. Internet-style democracy founds its expression in everything from _American Idol_ (where viewers use text messaging to vote for their favorite singers) to a campaign for Mountain Dew called “Dewmocracy" where consumers campaign for name and color of the next Mountain Dew beverage offering (Rushkoff 2009) This gamification is not an entry point for democratic participation but rather vulgarizes democracy as some form of consumer decision. Instead of using the net to increase opportunity, engagement, and levels of knowledge, the net seemed to be used in the opposite fashion. Internet-style democracy encouraged impulsiveness, impatience, siloing, and closed-minded hostility (Pariser 2011).

CNN and other news networks now use scientific-looking “people meters” to gauge instantaneous audience responses to candidates' speeches and debates. A line at the bottom of the screen indicates male and female enthusiasm for whatever a candidate is saying in that moment—as if the immediate reaction and the considered response were one in the same (Goodman, Rushkoff, and Dretzin 2003).

By amplifying the more gamified, amateur, and impulse-driven qualities of the net, e-democracy has not only missed the mark as an opportunity for a more participatory electorate and civic body, but also exacerbated some of the least productive elements of the spectator democracy so many believed would be obsolesced by the Internet. (McLuhan 1992) 

While the net may have failed democracy as a tool or platform, it may have succeeded on a more subtle yet ultimately deeper level as a media environment. That is, while the keyboards and Web sites and blogs and streaming video and social networks actually comprising the Internet may not be directly impacting the ways in which citizens engage in civics, digital technology as a cultural landscape is beginning to have a profound effect on the way people conceive of themselves in relationship to one another and institutions. Most significantly, as I will attempt to show in the case of the Occupy Wall Street movement, the net suggests new metaphors and demonstrates new principles that inform a novel amalgam of activist practices.

Permanent Revolution

Douglas Rushkoff

In politics, _f_or example, feedback used t_o o_ccur primarily in fou_r-y_ear cycles. The populace would vote for a president, that president w_o_ul_d_ g_o about his job, and then four years later he would get feedback in the fo_rm of being grante_d ano_ther term or kicked out of office_._ Pollsters arose to obtain f_ee_dback at tighter intervals _so_ that a poli tician could adjust policy (or even just his communicati_o_n about p_olic_y_)_ d_uri_ng his term. Digital technology, from live Twitter f_ee_d_s t_o real_-_time peopl_emete_r results now allows for instantaneous feedback. In a digital environment, _fe_edback and itera tion fold into one another.

Second and similarly, in a digital environment, narrati_v_es no l_o_nger work quite like they used to. Thanks to the remote control, the digital vide_o rec_order, the _j_oystick, an_d_ the mouse, traditional stories are de_c_onstructed, channel surfed, and fast forwarded (Rushkoff 1995). Aristotle was likely the first to identify the way that au_di_ences are carried through a story through their identification with a character. _T_his identification allows the audience to go up into tension as the tragic hero makes a series of decision_s_ that put him into jeopardy. If the audience could make any decisions on its own, they might have a way out other than to continue along with the character into peril, where they will ultimately have to accept the playwright's choice of how things end up. Like wise, anthropologist Joseph Campbell spent a career analyzing what he called "the hero's journey," a shape he believed was common to most mythology. This journey into peril for later redemption again required a captive audience, incapable of making its own decisions. These narrative techniques, as well as audience captivity, **were eventu** ally exploited by broadcast advertisers who learned to enact them in just 30 seconds, all for the benefit of a product. As audiences attained interactivity, however, the captivity required for this sort of propaganda—as well as the rest of traditional storytelling became threatened. With escape as close as the push of a button, audiences of all kinds become intolerant of the anxiety associated with the rising tension of a story.

In the deconstructed, cut-and-paste mashup of digital media, the messianic, ends-justify-the-means values of traditional journeys no longer find an environment consonant with their value systems. This is the realm of ongoing fantasy role-playing, not tragically terminal heroes. The digital environment is not a place for extended struggles, charismatic leaders followed by masses, or winner-takes-all campaigns. The structure of digital entertainment and problem solving is less like agonistic play with victors and vanquished than it is like James Carse's (1997) “infinite game”-one played for the sake of play. The object of the game is to keep the game going as long as possible.

This sensibility extends to the third characteristic of the digital media environment, its emphasis on prototyping over product. The shareware culture of the Internet led to what are known as “public betas"—the release of unfinished software to the public for testing and improvement. As Media Lab director Joichi Ito has explained (Ito 2011), there is no point testing a product in-house when there is a willing population of users out there ready to bang on one's programs. Besides, there is no time (see feedback and iteration above) to finish a product before seeing how people are going to react to it. Better to incorporate feedback into one's software in an ongoing fashion.

In short, the social media-enhanced civics now being discussed in many forums is most interesting--and ultimately promising--as a style of inquiry into the ways that the emergence of the net and accompanying changes in the social-scientific paradigm have altered our expectations of agency, participation, and change.

The digital environment, like any other media environment, is embedded with certain values that inform the culture within it. The textual environment encouraged new ways of thinking about accountability (written contracts), human interaction (written law), and even religion (the written Covenant with God--the Torah) (Logan 1987; Ong 2002). The printing press likewise changed the way people related to business (central banking), government (the Enlightenment), and the authority of the Church (personal Bibles and the Protestant reformation) (McLuhan 1962).

To parse the impact of the digital environment is a bit more difficult because we are currently living within its effects. I have identified four of the most pronounced conceptual shifts accompanying digitality in order to demonstrate the ways that the Occupy movement has utilized them as central operating principles for its new approach to activism and democratic participation.

The first is the notion of feedback. Traditionally, what we think of as feedback is simply the latent results of particular causes. Farmers plant in one season and get feedback months later in the yield of crop. Plant seeds too close together, and the crop competes for resources. These data are then incorporated into the next year's planting. Likewise, businesses send a product to market and then wait for sales reports to determine if the design and marketing were appropriate or could be improved upon. Each new iteration of planting or product design was based on the feedback from the one before.

In the dawn of the digital era, Cyberneticist Norbert Weiner (1965) saw in feedback a way of developing robots that could instantaneously “feel” and respond to changing conditions in the real world. Just as a thermostat senses the temperature in order to turn a heater on or off and an elevator "feels" for indicators at each floor instead of attempting to measure the distance between one floor and another, robots could be taught to rely no more on their programming than to the things around them. Each piece of feedback could be iterated into the next action.

With the help of systems theorists aided by computers (Miller and Page 2007), much _m_ore complex systems could be analyzed in terms of feedback and iteration. The screech one hears when placing a microphone too close to an amplified speaker—what we call feedback-is really just the cyclical loop of uncontrolled feedback, iterating back to the _m_icrophone and again to the speaker. It is analogous to any of the many chaotic systems from the weather to the stock market that evade the analysis of our normal faculties.

Computers give us a way to see such systems in terms of their feedback and itera tion. Fractals—the paisley graphics churned out by computers-are really just visual izations of the feedback and iteration of nonlinear equations. Their power is in their ability to render previously incomprehensible systems in graphics that make sense to the human viewer. As a result, we become more ready to understand feedback as an ongoing phenomenon rather than some occasional event.

Social media competency was not a prerequisite for participation. This is not to say **Occupy was divorced fro**m social media at all. The activities I saw on site, h_owev_e_r, mir_ rored the kinds of insig**hts and behaviors garnered fr_o_**m what I believe _wer_e the partici **pants' experiences—both direct and indirect-of** the digital media envi_ronmen_t.

For instance, Occupiers have an altogether new relationship t_o_ feedback than _tr_adi tional political movements. Although they occasionally march and shout, the ma_jo_rity **of activity is not direct_ed at or to_ anyon**e. Rather, it is lateral. Occupiers ar_e more_ focused on one another than the stockbrokers who may curs**e their encampment fr_om_ the periphery. The Occupation is a form of self-education. Rather than looking for **signs that their message has been "heard" by a politician or incorporated in_to so_me__ party's platform, they seek instead to develop coherence together.**

The result is less like the feedback and iter**ation of an election cycle, where the con stituency fee**ds back to the elected official, and more like the feed**back and iteration of a fractal or dynamic system. As such, it remains unrecognizable as a _f_orm of politics to those st**ill entirely within the pri**nting press or broadcast modality yet absolutely activ ist to partic**ipants within a digi**tal environment.**

**Likewise, the Occupy movement is nonnarrative (meaning, it does not follow the rules of storytell**ing, with a simple **beginning, middle, and end, but rather organizes itself and plays out in new ways—as different from a traditional campaign as a video game is from a Bi**ble story), per**haps even to a fault given the practicalities of our still largely broadcast-centric media culture. The main critique by mainstream media of the Occupy movement is its seeming inability to articulate clear goals or demands. This is at least part of why mainstream television news reporters appeared so determined to cast Occupy Wall Street as the random, silly blather of an ungrateful and lazy genera tion of weirdos. As if defending against the coming obsolescence of their own trun cated news formats, television journalists reported that the movement's inability to articulate its agenda in 10 seconds or less meant there was no agenda at all. CNN busi ness anch**or Erin Burnett (20**11) covered the goings on at Zuccotti Park in a segment** called Seriously?!“What **are they protesting?" she asked, "nobody seems to know." Like** _Tonight Sho_w comedian host Jay Leno'**s testing random mall patrons on American** History, her main objective **was to prove that the protesters did not know tha**t the U.S. **government had been reimbursed for the bank bailouts. More predict**ably, a FoxNews **reporter appeared flummoxed when the occupier he interviewed refused to explain how he wants the protests t**o "end." Attempti**ng to transcend the standard political nar rative, the protester explains “As far as seeing it end, I wouldn't like to see it end. I would like to see the conversation conti**nue" _(_Christopher 2011).

**In this sense, whether or not its economic agenda is grounded in reality, Occupy** Wall Stree**t does constitute the first truly postnarrative political movement. (By post narrative, I mean to emphasize the way this nonnarrative style is new and perhaps a successor to the traditional narrative styles that preceded it. It is a postnarrative move ment i**n that it is occurring **after centuries of narrative movements.) Unlike the civil rights protests, labor marches, or even the Obama campaign, it does not take its cue from a cha**rismatic leader, it does **not express itself in bumper-sticker-length goals, nor**

The approach of the Occupiers is more like a uni_ver_sit**y than a p_o_lítical _moveme_nt.** Both online and _o_ffline spaces consist largely of "teach-ins" about **the issues th_ey_ are** concerned about. Young people teach one another or invi**te guests to lect_ure t_h_em_** about subjects such as how the economy works, the disc_o_nnection of _inve_st_m_ent banking from the economy of goods and services, possible response**s t_o m_ass for_eclo_** sure, the history of centralized interest-bearing currency, and even best practices for civil disobedience.

It is unwieldy and unpredictable but oddly consistent with the values of a postnar rative landscape. The Occupy ethos replaces the _z_ero-sum, closed-ended gam_e o_f financial competition with a more sustainable, open-ended **game of abundance and** mutual aid. In the traditional political narrative, this sounds like **communism-but to** the Occupiers, it is a realization of the peer-to-peer sensibility **of the social net. It is not** a game that someone wins but rather a form of play that-li**ke a massive multiplayer** online game—is successful the more people get to play and the longer the game is kept going.

Finally, the Occupiers embody the player or hacker's approach to the political process. Each member of the movement is as capable and likely as any other to write or edit the operating system through which all of this activity takes place. Whether joining a general assembly, leading a working gr**oup, taking a role in developing or sustaining** the infrastructure, or organizing an entirely new encampment, each member is free to author his or her own contribution to the total effort.

As such, occupation becomes less a form of conditional, temporary, discrete politi cal activism than a new normative behavior. The culture of the net dissolves the boundaries between consumer and producer, programmer and user, and instead pro motes more of a peer-to-peer relationship between all members of the network. In a similar fashion, Occupy eschews hierarchies and defined roles in favor of modeling a new normative behavior for its participants. The occ**upation of Zuccotti or any other** encampment is just the most pronounced version of the occupation of reality itself.

As Occupiers become conscious of the consonance of their approach with the greater emerging digital landscape, the loss of Zucco**tti and other encampments** becomes less significant. As McLuhan might argue**, the protest encampment is merely** the "figure"—the particular content at one moment in time. The occ**upation concerns** the "ground"—the greater environment in which this activity is taking place. The indi vidual players and their temporary roles mean less than the changes to the playing field itself, our understanding of the extrapolitical means through which the soc**ioeconomic** parties or the mainstream corporate media. landscape can be revised, and the trivial value of recognition from either the political

The Occupiers appear to be groping instead for something more sustainably iterative than **the steady state of a** single solution. The only sort of permanence in the occupation is the ongoing process of revolution, itself.

int. The lack of specific goals

World Bank lending practices,

does it understand itself as having a particular end point. The lack of makes it hard to maintain focus. The movement may be attempting to em wide an array of complaints, demands, and goals: the collapsing environm standards, housing policy, government corruption, World Bank lending unemployment, increasing wealth disparity, and so on. Different people have a affected by different aspects of the same system and they believe that they are con toms of the same core problem. What upsets banking's defenders and trad Democrats alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in **tra**ditional language of campaigns.

But the Occupiers are simply native to different media environment than its detra tors. Unlike a political campaign designed to get some person in office and then cho up shop (as in the election of Obama and subsequent youth disillusionment), this is not a movement with a traditional narrative arc. It is not about winning some debate point and then going home. Rather as the product of the decentralized networked.es culture, it is less about victory than sustainability. It is not about one pointedness but inclusion. It is not about scoring a victory but groping toward consensus. In terms of **media** environments, then, it is not like a book or television—with neither a beginning middle, and end nor a pithy sound bite—it is as bottom-up and indeterminate as the Internet.

The Occupy movement is also imbued with digital culture's emphasis on prototyp ing. The encampments are no more a form of symbolic protest than they are workshop for prototyping new methods and reviving old methods of political engagement. They are beta tests. Occupy's "General Assembly" (Occupy Los Angeles n.d.) methodology, for example, is highly flexible approach to group **discussion and consen**sus building borrowed from the ancient Greeks. Unlike par**liamentary rul**es that promote debate, difference, and decision, the General Assembly forges consensus by "stacking" ideas and objections as they arise and then making sure they are all eventually heard. The whole thing is orchestrated through simple hand gestures. Elements in the stack are priori tized, and everyone gets a chance to speak. Even after votes, exceptions and objections **are incorporated as amendments.**

Strangers to the process are justifiably alienated by the General Assembly, and a certain facility with its processes is required. Those who do not know the hand signals cannot readily participate. But **from what I observed newcomers quickly came to** understand the General Assembly's rules**, either through observation and osmosis,** or the ready instruction by peers. In fact, the last place I had seen “newbies” so quickly and deliberately oriented by more experienced participa**nts was on t**he early Internet.

And like many online processes, such as the "collaborative filtering" done to bring popular results to the top of a Web page, the General Assembly seems like an evolu tionary leap forward in consensus building. Dispensing with preconceived narratives about generating policy demands or settling the score between Right versus Left, th_i_s process eschews debate (or what Enlightenment philosophers called "dialectic") fo_r_ consensus. It is a blatant rejection of the binary, winner-takes-all, political operating **system of the 13th century.**

1st-century science and

This is a politics consonant with the values and insights of 21st century scie technology. Unlike the innovations of the industrial age, which fostered prod. accumulation, central authority, and empire, those of the digital era are bincode replication and self-modification. Robotics, genomics, nanomachines, and digital na gramming do not render completed technologies but self-replicating, iterative We program them now, but they continue themselves, learning from experience, iter,

8 rom experience, iterat ing new versions, and carrying on the intentions of their original create ways.

So while the majority of public encampments and protests appear to have down, new forms and mutations of the Occupiers' presence emerge every day. There consciously net-named O_ccu_py _2._0_: Debt Strik_e (Taylor 2012), a student debt resistance movement, only came together in September of 2012. Another Occupy-driven debe _T_he People's Bailout (Mirzoeff 2012), seeks to raise money to purchase loans from credit agencies at pennies to the dollar and then simply forgive the debts entirely Th. timing of this activity bears no relationship to the national election occurring around it. It is as if the movement is on an entirely different calendar, operating in a parallel dimension. Given the tremendous differences between the digital media environment and what went before it, this may not be an inaccurate perception.
