**Abstract:** This paper looks at programming from the perspective of who controls it, who buys it, what it all means, and how Digital TV may be a catalyst for its change. It shows how interactive television may neutralize the coercive effects of traditional programming and empower a generation to rethink its relationship to the mediaspace and itself.
