**Abstract:** This paper looks at programming from the perspective of who controls it, who buys it, what it all means, and how Digital TV may be a catalyst for its change. It shows how interactive television may neutralize the coercive effects of traditional programming and empower a generation to rethink its relationship to the mediaspace and itself.

We love stuff because we can touch it. It's real. It has mass. It falls to the ground when we let go of it. There's also a special value that real objects can take on, too. A violin played by Stravinsky, a pen used by James Joyce, or a pillow on which the Buddha slept are treasured more than identical objects from the same periods because of the sentimental value we project onto them. Their molecules are no different even if their price tags or museum placement are. The "genuine article" is an ethereal notion, at best.

Traditionally, for objects to take on magical significance, they must be connected to history and lineage. A samurai sword, Faberge egg, or original copy of the U.S. Constitution is only passed on from one person or institution to another when the recipient has demonstrated proper allegiance to and regard for to the significance of the object, either through application, ritual, or a huge outlay of cash at Christy's.

The forms of spiritualism, entertainment, and play that kids explore today are all ways of reclaiming the right to assign value to the physical - in the midst of an increasingly digital world. A blessing conducted in a back alley can turn a trashcan lid into a holy platter. A kid making skateboard stickers with a Magic Marker on Avery Labels can claim the same level of authenticity as Chagall. If he's accepted as readily as Keith Haring, his work may even become as highly valued.

This desire to generate or declare objects of value has been both prompted and empowered by the arrival of digital technology in the home. What is an "authentic" Nirvana CD? The first pressing? A signed copy? Does that make the music any different? No. Once the transmission from artist or originator to consumer or viewer can be made in the form of reconstructed code rather than physical objects, the relationship between the two human beings involved changes, as well.
