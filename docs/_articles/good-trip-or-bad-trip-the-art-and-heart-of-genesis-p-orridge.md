Genesis P-Orridge's work defies objective analysis. So I won't even pretend that this little essay can accurately summarize or, dare I say it, codify his varied adventures in music, literature, art, magick, cultural engineering, and performance. Genesis's expressions are characterized, at least in part, by a breaking of conventional boundaries, a challenging of expectations, and a blurring of the usually polarized relationship between artist and spectator, performer and audience. To speak about Genesis's work is to speak the way a person projects oneself onto his work. Nothing more.

But if one man's experience of Genesis P-Orridge can serve to illustrate something about the shape of Genesis's intention--much in the way the tire treads across one's chest can be used to infer something about the car and driver that ran him over--then let me be of service. I have been impacted by this man, and I've lived to tell about it.

I first learned of Genesis while studying the history of the cut-and-paste aesthetic. I was devouring one of those great, early RE/Search books out of San Francisco, in which the lineage between William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin had been painstakingly chronicled. But who was this third man being added to the mix? Genesis P-Orridge? Wasn't he the lead singer for UK industrial band Throbbing Gristle?

Yes, but he was also the man who turned cut-and-paste from an experimental art form into an act of conscious defiance.

In the 1950s and 60s, Burroughs and Gysin had seen fit to turn post-modern deconstruction into a new kind of self-expression. Instead of merely deconstructing texts, they had the bright idea of recombining the many parts to see what came up.

Like the music of John Cage, it was a somewhat random process. The artist gets out of the way and allows the myriad of mathematical possibilities to unfold. The text of a newspaper article, for example, recombined into as many possible word orders as time, space, and probability will allow, yields strange results. We begin to understand the world of the article from a new perspective. Sometimes it feels as if secret codes have been unleashed (Burroughs was a rejected applicant to the CIA, after all). Other combinations give us an emotional overview of the newspaper's reality; or a political template. Sometimes, it even sounds sexy.

Genesis was fascinated with the cut-and-paste process too. He eventually tracked down Burroughs and Gysin, and became something of a protégé to them. But Genesis saw a different kind of voltage in the deconstruction process. To him, it was an appropriation. An opportunity to seize power that he'd been looking for all his life.

Genesis was born into a working-class English family, and, despite his station and some illnesses as a child, managed to earn a scholarship to an exclusive public (what we Americans would call private) school. There, Genesis learned firsthand which membranes of society were permeable and which were not. Often the victim of the worst mental and physical humiliations that privileged upper-class schoolboys could evolve in 20 generations of dormitory domination, Genesis learned that he was living in a world m which power was not earned--it was a birthright to the few. The pain and embarrassment he was forced to endure was meant solely to confirm their own sense of superiority in themselves, and to ingrain Genesis's inferiority in him.

But, as a child growing up in such an environment, Genesis couldn't help but wonder if there was more to it. Do these quasi-sexual acts of depravity have some intrinsic power? Are these boys doing something more than it appears? Is the power they will one day experience as the Lords of England somehow dependent on creating this fear and pain in others? Which comes first, the torture or the power? Genesis was participating, albeit unwillingly, in one of the oldest rituals practiced by some of the most powerful men in the world during their highly impressionable adolescent years. And these rituals were allowed, if not absolutely encouraged, by the headmasters charged with training and educating the power elite of the future.

Understandably, young Genesis developed a worldview that saw power as a kind of evil, maintained through ritual and protected by institutions. The rest of us were imprisoned in their world, incapable--or at least led to believe that we were incapable--of doing anything about it. They own the land, the buildings, the money, the media and the sex.

But maybe not the language.

Why were words like fuck so forbidden? What threat did they pose? Where did all these words we speak come from, anyway? Does anybody even remember that _good-bye_ means "God be with ye"? How much else is going on in the language we use--in the language we are taught not to violate? When was all this agreed upon, and by whom, and for what purpose?

To Genesis, Burroughs's cut-and-paste process was not simply psychedelic beatnik art. It was revolution. To deconstruct the language of the establishment is the first step towards appropriation. Whose language is this, anyway? Why are we speaking "King's English"?--especially if it benefits only a bunch of sick, rich fucks who flush your head down the toilet?

Genesis reveled in the appropriation and recombination of language, but sought to take it further. Deconstruction is the first step towards disempowering the masters of language. Demystification is the next step. Once you take apart the words, you can toy with them purposefully--not just randomly. A student of language, Genesis discovered the origins of words, as well as the assumptions underlying their common usage. Once the language itself could be questioned, so, too, could be the assumptions they are designed to enforce.

Finally, the words can be recombined, re-engineered to tip the balance of power in another direction. Why and when did thee become the? And what happens if you bring the origins of language back into play? Genesis moved from the deconstruction of language, through the demystification of its sources, to the engineering of new language that better stated the reality that he wanted to create. Do-it-yourself language.

Genesis's first word-poems in this vein were not aesthetic experiments, but magical sigils. The words themselves, and their placement on the page, were conceived in trance states and with the conscious intention of creating a new reality based on the deepest workings of mind and spirit. He was tapping language for its power, uncertain of what he would release, but daring enough to believe that if it made people uneasy, he must be onto something good.

A sigil is really just a focusing ritual, in which the magician concentrates on the object of desire or the state he wishes to create, and then places words or objects in a certain relationship to one another. Like a child who lays out the stones or shells she has collected over the course of a day, the magical artist arranges his words on the page in accordance with an intuitive psychic template. The resulting image contains, or represents, the thought structure that the magician is trying to bring into reality. The more mental and spiritual energy he can invest in this process, the more power the sigil will contain and, finally, release.

Genesis soon saw the value this process could be to his collage art. He had been developing the techniques of cutting and pasting pictures and images for years--since he was a young child. Now, those practical techniques could serve him in his translation of cut-and-paste language to cut-and-paste imagery. In a sense, they were the same thing. Like his word poems, each of Genesis's postcards and art pieces was a sigil, appropriating images that had been generated in one context for a certain reason, and recontextualizing them in a new context, for a very different one.

As Genesis expanded into other media, like music, he brought this same ethic and aesthetic of appropriation, demystification, and magical recontextualization into play. The "Industrial Music" that he and his cohorts in Throbbing Gristle pioneered takes the mechanized factory sounds of everyday life--the acoustic evidence of the working-class's subjugation--and recontextualizes it as a form of political art. His concerts and records were, themselves, sigils, in which the hidden powers of sound were explored and exploited.

but initiates. Young people who felt powerless in one way or another,

and who saw in Genesis's work and ideas the opportunity to seize

control of the language, images, and sounds of modern life.

By introducing so-called "modern primitive" aesthetics to the body

ornamentation and dress of what had by then become the Industrial

Movement, Genesis gave his audiences a chance to participate in

forms of personal re-engineering they had formerly never though :

possible. No, piercing one's nose or genitals in itself may not hold any

innate magical power, but breaking one's own preconditioned aver

sion to body modification may just reprogram one's passive relation-

ship to circumstance and existing power structures.

Genesis led the way, his own body a canvas and bisexual sigil. His mul-

tiply pierced genitals and deeply scarred and tattooed arms and chest

served as ample evidence of his commitment to make the seemingly

inviolable into plastic. He broke unquestioned sacred truths in order

to reclaim that which was truly and individually sacred.And thousands

followed suit. (Yes, from Throbbing Gristle right through to 21 JumP
