Genesis P-Orridge's work defies objective analysis. So I won't even pretend that this little essay can accurately summarize or, dare I say it, codify his varied adventures in music, literature, art, magick, cultural engineering, and performance. Genesis's expressions are characterized, at least in part, by a breaking of conventional boundaries, a challenging of expectations, and a blurring of the usually polarized relationship between artist and spectator, performer and audience. To speak about Genesis's work is to speak the way a person projects oneself onto his work. Nothing more.

But if one man's experience of Genesis P-Orridge can serve to illustrate something about the shape of Genesis's intention--much in the way the tire treads across one's chest can be used to infer something about the car and driver that ran him over--then let me be of service. I have been impacted by this man, and I've lived to tell about it.

I first learned of Genesis while studying the history of the cut-and-

paste aesthetic. I was devouring one of those great, early RE/Search

books out of San Francisco, in which the lineage between William S.

Burroughs and Brion Gysin had been painstakingly chronicled. But

who was this third man being added to the mix? Genesis P-Orridge?

Wasn't he the lead singer for UK industrial band Throbbing Gristle?

Yes, but he was also the man who turned cut-and-paste from an

experimental art form into an act of conscious defiance.

In the 1950s and 60s, Burroughs and Gysin had seen fit to turn post-

modern deconstruction into a new kind of self-expression. Instead of

merely deconstructing texts, they had the bright idea of recombin-

ing the many parts to see what came up.

Like the music of John Cage, it was a somewhat random process. The

artist gets out of the way and allows the myriad of mathematical pos-

sibilities to unfold. The text of a newspaper article, for example,

recombined into as many possible word orders as time, space, and

probability will allow, yields strange results. We begin to understand

the world of the article from a new perspective. Sometimes it feels

as if secret codes have been unleashed (Burroughs was a rejected

applicant to the CIA, after all). Other combinations give us an emo-

tional overview of the newspaper's reality; or a political template.

Sometimes, it even sounds sexy.

Genesis was fascinated with the cut-and-paste process too. He even-

tually tracked down Burroughs and Gysin, and became something of

a protege to them. But Genesis saw a different kind of voltage in the

deconstruction process.To him, it was an appropriation.An opportu-

nity to seize power that he'd been looking for all his life.

Genesis was born into a working-class English family, and, despite his

station and some illnesses as a child, managed to earn a scholarship

ere, Genesis learned firsthand which membranes of society were permeable and h · h w •c were not. Often the victim of the worst men- tal and physi I h ·i· . ca um, 1at1ons that privileged upper-class schoolboys could evolve in 20 • . generations of dormitory domination, Genesis learned that he w 1· • • • . as 1vmg m a world m which power was not earned -1t was a birthri ht t h I T · g o t e ,ew. he pam and embarrassment he was forced to end . ure was meant solely to confirm their own sense of

superiority in themselves, and to ingrain Genesis's inferiority in him.

But as a child gr · · . . • owing up 1n such an environment, Genesis couldn't

help but wonder if there was more to it. Do these quasi-sexual acts

of depravity have some intrinsic power? Are these boys doing some-

thing more than it appears? Is the power they will one day experi-

ence as the Lords of England somehow dependent on creating this

fear and pain in others? Which comes first, the torture or the power?

Genesis was participating, albeit unwillingly, in one of the oldest rit-

uals practiced by some of the most powerful men in the world dur-

ing their highly impressionable adolescent years. And these rituals

were allowed, if not absolutely encouraged, by the headmasters

charged with training and educating the power elite of the future.

Understandably, young Genesis developed a worldview that saw

power as a kind of evil, maintained through ritual and protected by

institutions. The rest of us were imprisoned in their world, incapable

\-or at least led to believe that we were incapable-of doing anything

about it. They own the land, the buildings, the money, the media and

the sex.

But maybe not the language.

Why were words like fuck so forbidden? What threat did they pose?

Where did all these words we speak come from, anyway? Does any-

body even remember that good-bye means "God be with ye" ? How

much else is going on in the language we use-in the language we are

taught not to violate? When was all this agreed upon, and by whom,

and for what purpose?

To Genesis, Burroughs's cut-and-paste process was not simply psy-

chedelic beatnik art. It was revolution. To deconstruct the language

of the establishment is the first step towards appropriation. Whose

language is this, anyway? Why are we speaking "King's

English"?-especially if it benefits only a bunch of sick, rich fucks who

flush your head down the toilet?

Genesis reveled in the appropriation and recombination of language,

but sought to take it further. Deconstruction is the first step towards

disempowering the masters of language. Demystification is the next

step. Once you take apart the words, you can toy with them pur-

posefully-not just randomly. A student of language, Genesis discov-

A sigil is really just a focusing ritual in which th · •

then places words or objects in a certain relationshi· t P o one anoth-

er. Like a child who lays out the stones or shells she has collected

over the course of a day, the magical artist arranges his words on the

page in accordance with an intuitive psychic template. The resulting

image contains, or represents, the thought structure that the magi-

cian is trying to bring into reality. The more mental and spiritual

energy he can invest in this process, the more power the sigil will

contain and, finally, release.

Genesis soon saw the value this process could be to his collage art.

He had been developing the techniques of cutting and pasting pic-

tures and images for years-since he was a young child. Now, those

practical techniques could serve him in his translation of cut-and-

paste language to cut-and-paste imagery. In a sense, they were the

same thing. Like his word poems, each of Genesis's postcards and art

pieces was a sigil, appropriating images that had been generated in

one context for a certain reason, and recontextualizing them in a

new context, for a very different one.

As Genesis expanded into other media, like music, he brought this

same ethic and aesthetic of appropriation, demystification, and mag•

ical recontextualization into play. The "Industrial Music" that he and

his cohorts in Throbbing Gristle pioneered takes the mechanized

ed a fan base unlike anything seen before. These weren't fans, exactty,

but initiates. Young people who felt powerless in one way or another,

and who saw in Genesis's work and ideas the opportunity to seize

control of the language, images, and sounds of modern life.

By introducing so-called "modern primitive" aesthetics to the body

ornamentation and dress of what had by then become the Industrial

Movement, Genesis gave his audiences a chance to participate in

forms of personal re-engineering they had formerly never though :

possible. No, piercing one's nose or genitals in itself may not hold any

innate magical power, but breaking one's own preconditioned aver

sion to body modification may just reprogram one's passive relation-

ship to circumstance and existing power structures.

Genesis led the way, his own body a canvas and bisexual sigil. His mul-

tiply pierced genitals and deeply scarred and tattooed arms and chest

served as ample evidence of his commitment to make the seemingly

inviolable into plastic. He broke unquestioned sacred truths in order

to reclaim that which was truly and individually sacred.And thousands

followed suit. (Yes, from Throbbing Gristle right through to 21 JumP

on in counter and then popular culture.)
