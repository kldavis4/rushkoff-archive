**Q:** _What's your perspective on Barack Obama and the economy?_

**DR**: Obama means the best, but we have to remember that he is working within a system; his perspective is presupposed by an economic model. And that model is biased toward those who have the means to accumulate capital, and against those who create real value. Obama said as much in his inaugural speech, when he spoke about finding ways to promote the interests of people who actually "do stuff."

Most of America's Founding Fathers foresaw this scenario. They had direct experience of the British East India Trading Company, a monopoly chartered by the crown. The monarchy wrote laws prohibiting colonists from generating value from the cotton they grew. They weren't allowed to fabricate clothes, for example. They had to sell cotton to the Company, at fixed prices, and buy back clothes from England.

The contemporary corporate economy works the same way--extracting value from the periphery to support debt payments to central banks. We have two separate economies going on--a speculative economy, which is the Wall Street economy, and the real economy, which is Main Street.

Most people are judging Obama's success through the metrics of Wall Street. Obama made a speech today and the Dow Jones average went down. Now, is that a good thing or a bad thing? It depends on your perspective. From my perspective, the stock market has already been exposed as a sham--a drag on the real economy. If it goes up after Obama speaks, it means then that people's faith in the phantom speculative economy has increased and thus their faith in the real economy has decreased. If the market goes down after Obama speaks, then might that mean that people realize the pyramid shell game of a stock exchange is no longer the place to be invested in, and that it is much more important to be invested in real things or to be on the side of people who are creating value rather than that of people who are extracting it?

**Q:** _Do you believe a Wall Street crash could be beneficial to the real economy?_

**DR**: I think the crash of the speculative economy is very painful for the real economy because jobs are lost and we're living on a landscape where it's very hard to recuperate. We've grown so dependent on our corporations for money and for employment that it's very hard to just create new employment in a non-corporate way. But it is entirely within our ability. We just forgot.

**Q:** _What is the function of interest rates in a speculative economy?_

**DR**: Interest rates are the way that most of the money is made in our economy. Money is created at an interest rate; it's lent into existence, and there's a ladder of institutions that lend down to each other until it gets to the business or person that is supposed to be the end user of that money. But money becomes too top-heavy when there are too many institutions to support with every dollar that's borrowed. And eventually the system stops working. So then the central bank tries to lower the interest rates so that people can still borrow it.

I think the current problem is not that there aren't enough people offering credit, but there's not the demand for the product that the banks are creating. They try to generate demand for currency by giving out really cheap loans on houses. That really was not about real estate at all. The myth of an "ownership society" was developed in order to generate more business for bankers--more excuses to borrow money in order to "own." It's not a secret cabal of conspiring bankers. But the banking industry has become a purely extractive force, and it's healthier to watch that crash now of its own accord than to have the big bloody revolution that would happen if we don't. I'd much rather see the global economy level the playing field all by itself than to have our artificially wealthy nation stampeded by those whom we exploit.

**Q:** _Americans are now reliant on foreign manufacturers. ls there any way this trend can be reversed?_

**DR**: I think we have to decide what it is that we think we can do well. We can look at the law of comparative advantage, the basic premise of which is that at full employment if you do the thing that you do best and let others do what they do best, everyone's going to end up doing well. At less than full employment, the law of comparative advantage no longer functions. So we can't just say, "Oh, if we're good at microchips we'll do that, and let China do car manufacturing." That's only beneficial to everybody if everybody's fully employed.

And we've reached the point of diminishing returns in terms of industrial age, mass-produced goods. We've found out that the only way to increase profits in a mass production scheme is either to make production cheaper or get more people to buy more stuff in less time. We've reached the limits of both. We have outsourced production, used poisonous materials, exploited populations and polluted vast territory. We've also reached our limits of consumption. People just can't consume anymore, they don't want to. They no longer find the sense of satisfaction in it--all our possessions separate us from each other rather than bringing us together.

By leaving the growth requirement of the speculative economy behind, we have an opportunity to make better stuff and more sustainable stuff, and actually look at ways to work less hours. It's not a fantasy at all--just look at the many local and sustainable businesses in America today. There are enough around. Places where they design and manage and manufacture their stuff and even source the material in one area and either distribute really widely or distribute to a certain region.

If you're no longer indebted to the bank or to an interest-driven economy, then you're much freer to create a sustainable business model. So then it's not a matter of saving industry as we know it, but rebuilding a scaled set of businesses tied to the real world and the communities in which they are operating. That's not a pipe dream, that's really possible.

deal of money relying on these \~mds of car-sharing programs, and don't miss

can direct you to programs m your community.

If you're spending too much on gas, there are also some proactive steps

you can take to limit your monthly fuel expenses:

Lighten Your Load: Unless you're living in your car, avoid overloading your vehicle. The more excess weight you add to your car, the more

gas you will burn.

Keep it Humming: Make sure that you take your car in for regular

tune-ups, maintenance and oil changes. When the engine is functioning

smoothly, it will require less gas.

Check Your Tires: When your tires aren't inflated properly, you'll be

burning more fuel, and you can quickly wear out the treads.

Take it Easy: Stay within the speed limit. Driving at lower speeds

improves your fuel economy. Fast starts and engine rewing also waste

precious gas.

use Cash: Most service stations charge extra fees to consumers who

use credit cards to purchase gas. Pay in cash and you'll save a bit of

money.

Get Organized: Try to run all of your errands in one day, as \~pposed

to making several small trips over the course of the week. T1\~e your

trips so that you can go when traffic is lightest, and you wont \~\~\~te

as much gas. If you need to stop at several places in th\~ sa_me v1cm1ty,

park your car in a central location and walk to your destinations.

Q: Doesn \~ this concept reconstruct the entire idea of profit making?

DR: Not reconstructing, but reviving. It goes back to the people who are the

supposed heroes of the corporate libertarians. Adam Smith was looking for a

scaled economy of small businesses and farmers, and people doing things. He

thought local businesses would always do. better and the people would always

prefer to do business locally because they're going to be biased toward the

places where they live. It's not really a step backwards,

to the hunter-gatherer stage. Just a human one.

Q: Cities aren 't particularly sustainable. What practical advice do you have for

urban dwellers?

DR: You can do urban agriculture and rooftop gardens and reduce the stress

load and energy costs. But you're limited. I would think that people in urban

areas can certainly sign on for Community Sponsored Agriculture, subscribe

to a farmer, go out every couple of months and actually help. There's enough

to do in the urban terrain as well. It's not like cities need to go away. You can

contribute to your public school rather than sending your kid to private school.

Take the $20,000 worth of time that you would have spent \[ on a private school}

and spend those hours making a public school better. That way you're actually

reinvesting in a city.

Cities do accomplish certain things well. Unless we have a sudden population decline, we're going to need people who are willing to stack up on each

other like that for the rewards of getting to see lots of people, getting better

nightclubs, bigger bookstores or whatever you might get. That's

Q· Js this what you mean when you describe the current fin . • . ,, ancia/ crisis as a "unique opportunity ? .

DR: Yes. The other unique opportunity is the development of local and alternative currenciesJn Washington and Oregon you've got the Fourth Comers

exchange; there's also the LETS (Local Exchange Trading Systems) system,

there's Time Dollars. There's lots of ways to earn money into existence rather

than borrow it into existence. It could be as simple as starting a babysitting club

where people earn babysitting hours for every hour they babysit. And maybe

people will start being willing to accept babysitting hours as a unit of currency,

as a standardized unit. You know, if you give me three babysitting hours, I'll

give you this record, or I'll give you this book I wrote, or I'll give you this food

I grew and then I'll spend the babysitting hours hiring·another kid to babysit.

Q: Do you mean a barter system as opposed to a Federal Reserve note system?

DR: In a sense, but it doesn't have to be barter. Just real. Barter implies a twoway thing; that I get your thing and you get mine. Money-actual currencyallows for a third or fourth party to enter into the transaction. There's a restaurant in my town that needed money to expand and the banks weren't lending

any more money. So the owner asked the community for money to expand,

and the way we're paying him is by buying restaurant dollars. For every dollar we spend we get $1 .20 worth of redemption at the restaurant. If you put in

$500 you get $600 worth of food. That gives me a twenty percent return on my

money-and it's money I'd spend anyway, because it's the only organic restaurant in town. Meanwhile, the restaurant owner gets the money cheaper than he'd

get it from a bank. 'Yhat's that? That's an alternative currency.

Look at the Eldercare dollar system in Japan where people needed their

elderly to get taken care of during a serious recession when no one had money

or jobs. They created an alternative currency system through which people

could invest their time; you'd bathe someone's grandmother where you live,

and you'd earn a certain number of credits for someone else to take care of your

grandparents in a distant town. Each kind of task-like bathing, cooking meals

or playing ·gin rummy-had a different, per-hour value attached to it. Hundreds

of millions of dollars worth of health care was provided in this way in a country

where no one had the money to buy it but everyone had time because they were

all unemployed. And now that the economy has gotten better, the old people still

To understand why we always seem to go over budget when we shop for

groceries, try to keep in mind that there's an underlying psychology to how food

is displayed at the supermarket. For example, a tactic called "eye-level marketing" ensures that the most expensive products will always be most visible to

consumers. Another common strategy involves placing staple items near the

back part of the store so that you'll be tempted to toss various non-essential

goods into your shopping cart while you make the lengthy trek to the meat or

dairy section. If you 've ever wondered why there's always a line at the various

checkout counters, some store managers will limit the number of cashiers on

duty so that people will spend more time inside the store.

These are just a few of the clever. stratagems used by supermarkets to

keep us buying what we don't need. However, it isn't all that hard to outwit

these subtle behavioral cues. For one thing, never go to the supermarket when

you're hungry. Your re_sistance will easily break down if you run across something that looks particularly mouth-watering. Wait until you've had a hearty

meal, and then take care of business. However, before you even set foot inside

the store, make sure that you have a comprehensive shopping list in hand and

tick to it with an almost monk-like devotion. Don't allow yourself any excep-

\~ons. Plan ahead and even consider making out weekly or monthly menus so

that you can handle all of your shopping needs in a single trip each month. The

f wer times you have to go to the store, the less temptation.

e once you've got your shopping habits in check, let's take a look at some

other ways you can pare down your food expenses:

coupons: If you're really serious abo_ut staying within your budg\~t,

coupons will come in handy by reduc1\~g your monthly grocery bill.

Most supermarkets post coupons on their web pa\~es_for easy access.

However, don't fall into the trap of buying som_ethmg Just because you

have a coupon. Limit your coupon shopping to items you purchase on

a regular basis.

Carb-Loading: Atkins Diet aside, there's nothing wrong with a hearty

meat-free dinner a couple times a week. If you can load up on paSt

a or ,a

rice dish every other day, you won't need to buy as much m\~at, 8nd you 1

\~

save money. At the very least, consider opting for inexpensive sources o

protein like canned tuna, lentils, cheeses, peanut butter or beans.

Shop in Seasons· Familiarize yourself with what fruits and vegetables are in season \~ach month, as that's when prices tend to drop.

we currently call money.

Q: Do you believe people will start adopting these measures and moving away

from the 7-Eleven consumer mindset?

DR: People don't generally abandon consumer capitalism unless their feet are

held to the fire. We have some very well constructed myths of wealth and currency. Sometimes the only way for those m\~h.s to get shattered is through shock

and awe. The fact that America now has a cns1s may be enough to jostle us

loose from our death grip with bank-driven capitalism.

Q: Have you seen anything recently that has changed your perspective of what's

happening with the economic crisis?

DR: It's bumming me out that the metrics people are using to gauge the economic crisis are actually the metrics that indicate how shackled we are to the

failed model. Mortgage rates and stock averages are not true signs of prosperity.

They are life signs of the dying capital infrastructure. But I'm encouraged by

how innovative people are being and how they're not seeing every social and

economic innovation as part of a weird, lefty communal paradigm. And when

people actually do it, it seems entirely nonnal and real. •

con- stantly tossing perfectly good food . Whether it's slightly bruised (but

perfectly edible) fruits and vegetables , TV dinners or frozen vegetables

It's a good idea to avoid any wild plants growing near homes or apartments

as they may have been sprayed with pesticides. You should also try to kee '

away from plants that sprout near possibly contaminated rivers and lakes, a\~

well as roadside shrubs and weeds, which are often tainted by vehicle emissions. Avoid mushrooms as a rule of thumb, as the risk of accidental poisoning

may outweigh any nutritional benefit they might have. For a basic primer on

survival foraging, Wilderness-Survival.net is an excellent choice.

Sources of Income

WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF WORK AND COMPANIES AREN'T HIRING, GENERating income can be difficult. If your primary focus is finding any kind of survival job to tide you over, registering with a temporary agency might be a good

strategy to at l\~ast get back to work. As companies scale back staff, there will

still be a pressing need for additional workers to cover for people on vacation

or to help complete labor-intensive projects. Some of the larger agencies, like

Manpower (manpower.com) even offer benefits to employees. Of course temp

agencies take a cut from any money you earn, but this might be a good way to

get back to work and make connections with employers, and there is also the

possibility that a temporary position could evolve into a permanent job.

Temp agencies are also a good way to add more flexibility to your work

schedule. If you'd prefer to concentrate on your job search for part of the week,

you can make arrangements with the agency to only be called for work assignments on specific days. If you're thinking about temping, it's probably a good

idea to register with more than one agency. As unemployment rises, there will

likely be stiff competition for what temporary positions are available. Check

your telephone book to see what agencies serve your area. You will probably

be asked to register in person, as they will want to give you a skills test and

read through your resume.

Starting a home-based business is another possibility. However, you're

going to be in something of a bind. If you're short of money, whatever business you pursue is going to require very little operating and start-up capital.

Moreover, it won't be easy marketing and selling a product or service in the

middle of a serious recession.

Along with the tens\~on-filled weeks when you're struggling with a deadline:

there m\~y be dry pe_riods when you can 't seem to /and work. Living in the present wont be an option. Once you 've completed a project, no matter how tired

you might be, you will need to redouble your energies and start looking for

new assignments. "The check is in the mail". will become a familiar refrain, as

freelancers often aren't paid on time and sometimes will wait weeks or even

months before payment is received.

However, you can set your own hours and be your own boss, and for many

individuals that's of far greater importance. It's also a lot easier to get freelance work thanks to the internet. If you have a background in writing, editing, data entry, programming, web design or social networking technology, you

might try registering with Elance.com, which allows you to place bids on shortterm work projects. Guru.com is another popular site for freelancers looking

for work, as is Craigslist.com.

Freelancing isn't for everyone, and you may be leaning toward something

a bit more basic. Perhaps what you have in mind is something that will provide a slow but consistent revenue stream that can tide you over until you've

found work, or possibly something that might work out as a second source of

income even if you do find a full-time position. Try out some of the ideas listed

below- they won 't require a great deal of money to get started, and over time,

they could start generating some cash:

Scrap Metal: If you have a truck or van and ample storage space,

ling scrap metal is the kind of business that can start bringing

in money immediately. Start small with aluminum cans, and put your

scavenging skills to work at dump sites, garbage bi\~s and garage \~r

sales, where you might run across electrical wiring, used car batteries and other artictes that contain lead, brass, iron, steel, copper and

other base metals. Let people in your neighborhood know that you're

interested in old stoves, car batteries and metal fixtures and that you'll

remove them free of charge. Advertising in your community newspaper

or on Craigslist may also be a good idea.

Employment Consultant: When people are desperate to find work,

they'll do anything that will give them an edge. If you have a writing

background and good formatting skills, you might try setting up a service in your community to help individuals seeking work. You can design

resumes and compose cover letters, and for an added fee even help

prospective job seekers set up a Facebook or Linkedln page to show to

prospective employers.

Buyer /Seller: This may require a bit of capital up front, but buying

low\~st items at garage and yard sales and reselling them on eBay may

prove to be a profitable sideline if you have a good eye for value and can

gauge public demand. People tend to look for bargains and buy things

used when the economy isn't doing well. You might also consider selling

other people's valuables on consignment for a cut of the profits.

initial health screening (which takes about two hours) and are declared

fit to donate plasma, you will generally receive $20-35 in compensation each time you donate.· 1f you're interested, check your telephone

replenishes plasma faster than blood, you can donate up to twice a

week. However, be sure to eat something at least two hours before you

go, and drink plenty of water. If you're lucky enough to possess a rare or

unique blood type, or your plasma contains specific antibodies that are

in demand, you may even be designated a "special plasma seller" and

you'll be placed in a higher compensation bracket.

sperm banks and fertility clinics. You'll be asked to come in and submit a sperm and blood sample. You'll also be asked to complete an

latter may require some additional legwork on your part, as some sperm

sample and upwards into the thousands.

Research Subject: Why not contribute to scientific progress and

get paid at the same time? College students have been volunteering

as research subjects for years. If you live near a large university, there

are usually advertisements posted in campus .newspapers and on bulletin boards requesting research subjects. You can also check online

at GPGP.net, which maintains a national directory of ongoing research

that requires participants for everything from sleep deprivation studies

to consumer focus groups. As with any medical or psychological procedure, it's probably a good idea to go into it with your eyes wide open and

make sure you are aware of any possible risks. If you have any doubts

or misgivings, try another research study.

Pawn Your Valuables: Most pawnbrokers can smell desperation a

mile away, but if you're really in dire need, pawning a few of your possessions might be your only option. Don't expect to get a lot of money-but

on the plus side, the less money you get, the easier it will be to redeem

your possessions.

When your finances are in a perilous state, life can be challenging.

Hopefully some of the suggestions we've covered in this chapter will at the

very least provide you with a basic game to fall back on should you counter any

difficulties. Always remember that adversity can often prove to be a catalyst for

growth. The economic coping skills you develop today will make you stronger

and that much more resilient in the future. •
