"So it's, like, cool, this doesn't hurt," he said. "It's a free ride from now on."

"Is it really?"

"Fer sure. I'm just waiting for the clear light. Sorry about the piss, though. It must stink. I couldn't help it."

"Quit it, OK?"

"Is that the sirens?" he asked, staring up at the flashing strobes. "The lights?" The boy lay on his back at the far edge of the dancefloor. Most everyone else had gone back to their partying - he was just another tripped out kid. Couldn't handle the scene. Or did they ignore him for fear of caring too much? The empathy of E can work in reverse: you simply avoid what you don't want to meld with. "Fuckers," he said, half laughing. "Can't wait till they see the stretcher."

"Don't," she said.

"I'm just talking, Bess," he said. "Makes it easier to stay awake. I'll stop."

"No. It's better to stay awake. That's true. I've heard that. Say what you have to. Even if it's mean."

"It's not a concussion, you know. It's not like I'm going to keep myself out of a coma. It's not that at all. I'm dying here."

"Don't talk that way. Someone's coming with water. You'll be fine. If you don't give up. Feel yourself free. Just think 'life'."

"Did you read that on some rave flyer? Something in LA? Or was it some TV ad against abortion? You can be so dumb sometimes."

"And you can be cruel, Manuel."

He watched the other kids dancing, oblivious to his plight. It was a madhouse, he thought. Some essentially good vibe had been there at the outset. Back in the early nineties. Maybe. But now the energy and karma of all these kids was just being siphoned out as cash by some businessmen. They had been sucked dry. Pure energy converted to pure marketing.

And, to Manuel Jarrow, this place seemed to symbolize it all. A much-too-shiny New York nightclub pretending to be a rave venue. No matter how late it was - two? three? - or how many of the Day-Glo kids pressed together in the room, the whole place reeked of business, grime and scam-artists. New York really was a terrible place to try to throw a party. It was a nightmare to get anywhere. In the UK, a rave meant a road trip. In SF it meant a hike to the beach. But in NYC, it meant a subway ride (with two transfers) through rat-, bum-and cop-infested tunnels that smelled like human piss - just to get to stand in line in the cold and wait for a fat guy with a walkie-talkie to decide whether you were cool or rich enough to be let inside.

Bess went off to try again for some water and to see if the ambulance was coming. Manuel couldn't tell if it was the lights or his head making everything spin so. He wished he had his camcorder. To document the fall of the scene. There were so many scenes he wouldn't ever have the chance to tape. So many he should have, too, but didn't. Now he never would.

The dehydration wasn't bothering him any more. He had been so thirsty before. Back when he went to the bathroom only to find all the sinks shut off. But now he wasn't thirsty at all. Just tired. Ready.

"The girl at the Smart Bar gave me this," Bess said, returning with a small plastic cup of orange liquid. "She said it would help."

Manuel waved it off, but Bess knelt beside him and held his head on her knee as she moved the cup to his lips. "You have to try."

He swallowed a gulp or two and smiled. Then he wretched it out all over her leg. "I'm sorry, Bess," he said, "but I told you..."

"I wish we never came here tonight," she said. "The raves were never like this in San Francisco. We never should have come to New York at all."

"It was your fucking idea."

"That's not fair," she said. "You wanted to come, too. You thought you'd get a job doing guerrilla TV, remember?"

"You were the one who loved it here. The big city. The real people. So close to Europe and history."

"I liked it until now," she said. "What did we do to deserve this?"

"It was the coke," Manuel said. "I shouldn't have spent that last tenner on the blow. We were so thirsty, too. I should have seen what was happening. But the water cost three-fifty a pop and we hadn't done any coke in so long. The E was so pure, too. Nothing speedy in it and I was starting to fade. I guess I learned my lesson."

"But you didn't deserve this."

"Deserve to die?"

"That's not what I meant. You're going to be OK," she told him. "Everything is going to be OK."

"Yeah. You just keep telling yourself that."

"You do it," she said. "I'm too beat."

_Now in his mind he saw the billsides of Santa Cruz, just behind the university. The place they called Elf Land. He was sitting on a rock with a bunch of college students - a few years older than be was. They were all drumming together into the night._

_Maestrooms were such a special drug. So natural. So real. They made you dissolve into the words and then get born all over again as part of the Earth's green network of creation. Like Swamp Thing. The beats of the boys' drums - the rhythms mixed with the many rhythms of the forest. The crickets sang along, their high-pitched chrips in tentative syncopation with the human tribal celebration._

_This was one of the things be had seved to shoot. Close-ups on the bands as they pounded the skins, intercut with high-magnifications of cricket legs scratching together. He meant to go back there and find those kids again, but with his camcorder and maybe some battery-powered lights. Blues and greens to match the woods._

_The idea came shortly after dosing in a dorm room. They knew nothing about drumming but felt called upon to add to the pool of resonance in which they found their heads already swimming. Someone just grabbed a drum and headed outside and it felt so right to follow. They had wandered for hours before finding the spot. The special spot where, as the 'shrooms came on, all five boys realized at once they had meant to be united forever in time._

_The music began in clumsy fits and starts. Military beats with strict male conformity, eventually giving way to affected tribal rhythms and Zepplinesque flourishes. Questions and answers. Day-o, Day-o, Manuel thought, like tourists on a cruise ship. The harder they tried, the more pretentious it got_

_But once they gave up trying something happened. They were no longer playing with one another, listening consciously and trying to fit in or assert a new counterpoint. The form and meter just disintegrated into dots of beat. Waves of sound, disconnected from each other yet completely articulate as a whole. They just danced around one another's rhythms - no one leading, no one relegated to the click track. Spiralling hands against animal skin, generating waveforms that reverberated against the trees. Perfect and unstoppable. Infinite yet contained. A total sound so complete it may as well have been squeezed out of a toothpaste tube. Another image he would never record._

_He got an e-mail maybe six months later that one of the boys had died in a wreck. On the way back up the hill from a Full Moon rave on the Santa Cruz beach. The van just toppled over the cliff. It took the cops hours to extract him from the car. They were trying to keep his neck from moving, but be died of internal injuries in the meantime._

"We never went to that guy's funeral, did we?" he asked the girl who was kneeling beside him on the floor of the club, now, on Manhattan's lower West Side.

"We couldn't get a ride, remember?"

"Why should I remember that?"

"We could never get rides out of San Francisco. That's part of why we came here."

"Right. To suffer together and then die."

"Why are you being like this?" she asked. "You're not going to die, OK? And even if you are, why kill everything else, too?"

"Am I killing something? Really? You should know."

"Stop it, OK? You're being such an asshole."

"Look, I'm a little freaked-out, OK?" he said, retreating into the convenience of his own demise. "Don't listen to me. I always loved you, ok?" He didn't know whether he wanted to go with the tables cleared off or not. "I won't bring up all the nasty stuff again, ok?" he said.

"You can be so sweet when you want to."

"And it's all fake. It always was."

"You fucker. Why are you doing this?"

"I don't want to ignore anything. I want to look. I don't want to chicken out."

He dozed off for a few seconds that seemed like minutes. There was still no sign of an ambulance, and the kids on dancefloor were all pressed up against one another on the other side of the room. Pete-E, the kid who had sold them the doses was bending down over Manuel, trying to get him to drink some water from his canteen.

"Bess went to call for the ambulance again," Pete-E said. "You should really try to drink. You're dehydrated, that's all. Just drink some water."

"Those fucking club promoters want to squeeze every last dime out of us," Manuel said. "It's not enough to charge fifteen to get in. We won't buy their fucking alcohol so they plug up the sinks to make us pay for their mineral crap."

"It sucks, I know," Pete-E said, 'We've got a petition started. But right now you have to drink something. If you don't they'll stick an IV in you when they come. You don't want that, do you?" Pete shuffled uncomfortably as he stood over his wan, corpse-like customer. "We don't need that kind of mess, Manuel, do we?"

So that was it. Compassion always turns out to have that "ass" in it. "I better leave you with this water and go. You won't say anything about me when they come, will you?"

"You're clear," he said. "Go!"

Manuel was thinking about Bess. He knew she had faults from the time he met her. But the fact that she was so rich seemed to make her immune to the grabby-grabbies that now infected everyone else in the scene. All anyone cared about anymore was how to make money off newbies. Sell the vibe. Make better flyers than the competition. Have a better-stocked smart bar. Hell, there were already ten brands of "herbal ecstasy" on the market, all practically identical except for the packaging. And every one of those smart drink powders came from the same damn company in Southern California. Club promoters just printed out their own labels on the Mac, slapped them on and then marketed the same old stuff as something unique.

Bess didn't care about making any money. She had her trust fund, and if she was looking for anything it was some traction. Friction. Some meaning in the from of conflict. That's why she took to Manuel, even though he was just a squatter in the Mission district. He was doing something real, and she could appreciate it.

Meanwhile, Manuel could appreciate her indifference to the demands of the social marketplace. Plus, she could cut the line at any club in town. The fact that she paid for his Sony Hi-8 camcorder, didn't hurt either.

Did he love her? Who knew? As long as he didn't think about it too much, everything was pretty cool. She had a great figure and a really pretty face. At twenty-six she was a few years older than him, but that was cool, too. It meant she didn't fall for all the posers and their wide-eyed schemes. Well, none of the posers except for Manuel, which was fine by him.

He never should have left for that camcorder conference in Berlin. The video he shot of the homeless in the Panhandle clashing with city police put his work on the map, and an all-expenses-paid trip to Europe - his first time abroad - was too tempting to pass up. That's what gave it all away. It broke the sham. He was in it for the promise of stardom, and nothing he told her about the opportunity to network and exchange ideas with other camcorder artists sounded real. He could have gone that wasn't the point. It was how much he panted over the whole thing.

Plus, she was seven weeks pregnant. At twenty-one the last thing he needed was a baby, but he wasn't going to be the one to make a life-or-death decision about a foetus. That was the girl's job.

So he left Bess and the whole dilemma behind to go gallivanting in Berlin with the coolest of the cool, squatting in buildings bombed-out since the Second World War. So what if he was being a bit irresponsible? He was the younger one, after all. The artist with no allegiance other than his work.

The fifteen-year-old girl he met at the pub in what used to be East Berlin and just had to sleep with didn't help matters, either. It wasn't for love, he insisted later, but for the pure aesthetic adventure. She was five feet eleven, blonde, blue-eyed, and just through puberty: the perfect Aryan princess. The kind of girl they put a bunch of make-up on and photograph for the cover of _Vogue_. It was a mythic experience no artist should pass up.

But he shouldn't have taken the E and then called Bess at four in the morning to confess the whole thing. By the time he got back to San Francisco two weeks later, Bess had aborted their baby and made plans to move to New York.

The two eventually made up leaving their respective indiscretions unchallenged. The only term of their reconciliation was that she would be more in charge of things than him from now on. She'd pay the rent in New York, and he'd stay out of trouble - not legal or artistic trouble, mind you - only the kind of trouble she didn't approve of.
