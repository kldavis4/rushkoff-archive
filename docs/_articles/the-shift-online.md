Although I like to think of myself as "clued in" to the motions of nature, they seem to evade me. But that's finally beginning to change. I write mostly about technology and its effects on culture and spirituality. I see technology as a real extension of nature--an expression of the evolutionary drive towards complexity and consciousness. It wasn't always this way. As originally implemented, technology was developed to deny the underlying patterns of nature. We invented electric lights to deny the blackness of night and the rhythm of daybreak. Heat and air conditioning allowed us to deny the climactic cycle of the seasons. Irrigation helped us conquer the patterns of weather. We fly in planes to break the laws of distance and break multiple time zones in just a few hours, throwing our bodies out of their own circadian rhythms. We invent pills from dexedrine to melatonin to convince our bodies otherwise, then wonder why we feel so out of touch. In this scenario, nature is the enemy and human technology keeps it at bay.

If human culture is an articulation of nature, then media is the articulation of technology. As civilization and culture grew out of the natural collection of human beings, media grew out of technology to control and restrict our free motions and underlying collective will. Just as technology denies nature, traditional media denies humanity. At any major university, you will find that the study of communications has nothing to do with helping people talk to one another. It is the study of how governments can manipulate their subjects or citizens, and how corporations can manipulate their customers and employees. It is not the study of communication--it is the research and development of social programming.

Media was put into place as a way of controlling the natural ebb and flow of society. By dividing amorphous populations into manageable market segments and interest groups, the social scientists could more accurately predict and alter our behaviors. Television and other top-down media arose to program the masses into submission. Why do you think they call it TV programming? They're not programming the television sets; they're programming the viewers.

Media programming only works when the programmer has the luxury of a captive and isolated audience. Like any form of hypnosis, television programming depends on the viewers' reception without distraction. The subject allows her thoughts to be directed and ordered by the programmer. Her naturally free-form, holistic consciousness is made linear. She learns to follow the leader, step by step.

Television worked perfectly. The viewer sat alone and let herself be drawn into the trance. From this point, the programming part was simple: tell stories. Since Aristotle and even the Bible, the programmer has used stories to reduce his audience to passive participants. For aboriginal cultures, the story has served as a way of preserving sacred ancient ideas as they pass down through generations. For modern Western culture, the technique of the story has been abused to enforce purchasing decisions and moral agendas.

The traditional story works by putting the audience in a state of tension. The programming storyteller creates a character we like so that we identify with this hero's plight. Then, the character is placed in jeopardy of one sort or another. As the character moves up the incline plane towards crisis, we follow him vicariously, while taking on his anxiety as our own. Helplessly we follow him up into danger, disease, or divorce, and just when we can't take any more tension without bursting, the hero finds a way out. He finds a moral, a product, an agenda, or a strategy that rescues him, and us along with him, from the awful anxiety. The higher the level of tension we've been able to create, the more preposterous the hero's critical twist can get. But whatever solution the character finds, the audience must swallow it, too. Along with it, we swallow the sponsor or network's agenda, but at least we get to escape from the anxiety.

This is what it means to "entertain"--literally "to hold within"--and it only works on a captive audience. In the old days of television, when a character would walk into danger and take the audience up into uncomfortable anxiety, it would have taken at least 10 or 20 calories of human effort for the viewer to walk up to her TV set and change the channel. The viewer was trapped. As long as the programmer didn't raise the stakes too abruptly, she would stay in her La-Z-Boy and go along for the ride. The remote control changed that.

With an expenditure of perhaps .0001 calories, the anxious viewer is liberated from her tortuous imprisonment. Although most well-behaved adult viewers will soldier on through a story, kids raised with remotes in their hands have much less reverence for these well-crafted arcs, and zap away without a moment's hesitation. Instead of watching one program, they skim through ten at a time. They don't watch TV, they watch the television, guiding their own paths through the entirety of media rather than following the prescribed course of any one programmer.

No matter how much we complain about our kids' short attention spans, their ability to disconnect from programming has released them from the hypnotic spell of even the best TV mesmerizers. The Nintendo joystick further empowers them while compounding the programmer's dilemma. In the old days, the TV image was unchangeable. Gospel truth piped into the home from the top of some glass building. Today, kids have the experience of manipulating the image on the screen. This has fundamentally altered their perception of and reverence for the television image. Better yet, the computer mouse and the Internet turn the video monitor into a doorway. No longer just an appliance for passive programming, the monitor is a portal to places and ideas. Kids with camcorders don't even bother to watch prepackaged programs. They just make their own.

The people I call "screenagers," those raised with interactive devices in their media arsenals, are natives in a media-space where even the best television programmers are immigrants. They speak the language better and see through those clumsy attempts to program them into submission. They never forget for a moment that they are watching media, and resent people who try to draw them in and sell them something. We mistake their ironic detachment for cultural apathy. It's not. They do care; they're just unwilling to take on a character's anxiety and then swallow some hidden agenda.

The shows embraced by the "screenage" generation accept the inherent discontinuity of the television medium--and our natural world--rather than trying to smooth it out. Most traditional programming attempts to smooth over discontinuity, lest the programmer lose his audience. When they have to break for a commercial, they introduce a cliff-hanger to tide us over. It's discontinuity pretending to be continuous, and it comes across as false.

But where adults are challenged by gaps, kids thrive on them. Just consider the difference between the experience of an adult skier and a child snow-boarder descending a slope. The adult, with his long parallel skis, looks for the smoothest, most powdery path possible. The kid seeks out the bumps, rocks, and patches of ice. They thrive on discontinuity because, deep down, they sense it is real and not contrived.

Kids experience media and technology

differently because they are on the far side of

the evolutionary shift-that same shift the

writers in this book are proclaiming. As I see

it, this shift is in the way we tell stories.

The extended evolution of storytelling

outlined i n my book, Playing the Future,

:lescribes the three main stages of nearly every

cultural inve n tion . W e sta re with a \\ite ra\\ phase.

For money, this is gold . lt h as actual, \\i.ce ra \\

value. For W est e rn religion, this is che Ten

Commandments. Do this, don't do that. It works

with simple, straig ht lines, and works when

one's experience is very limited. The second stage is metaphor. The metaphor for gold was the gold certificate. Paper

money represented a real value of gold. For religion, it was Jesus and the parable. Teaching

stories, such as the one about the prostitute in

the road about to be stoned, work as metaphors

for the situations in our lives. Better than a literal rule, a teaching story can be applied to

thousands of possible real-life dilemmas. If we

can all identify with the character in the story

then the parable works. That's why they'r\~

called parables: a parabola is a curve that depicts

the relationship of a single point to whole line. ,As long as we' re in a linear world, and all stand in a line, the point of story will relate to us all.

Stories require heroes we all relate to-super.

beings, hierarchy, and allegiance. We moved

from straight lines to curves or, mathematical1 y, from x=y to x2

=y.

But our world, and certainly the world

of our children, is too chaotic for us all to stand

in a line and respect one authority. Our kids

Western civilization needs "a new myth." We

need a new kind of myth. Recapitulated media has

come to the rescue.

in place to contain nature, and the media may

infrastructure became too complex for anyone-William Randolph Hearst, Rupert

Murdoch, or Bill Gates-to control. Although

the wires may have been set down to function

as avenues for unidirectional programming, no

one predicted that we would start connecting

them up and talking through them. Faxes,

telephones, camcorders, modems, and computers changed the top-down quality of the mediaspace. We all started communicating with one

another. No one in charge had taken into

account the fact that electrons don't care which

way they travel through a wire.

They know no allegiance. There's no up

or down, so hierarchy and one-pointedness is

impossible.

Even more disastrous for those who would

dominate nature and program human beings, technology and the media have begun to express the

underlying drive of evolution itself: for awareness,

complexity, and connectivity. Evolution is the way

nature expresses itself over time. In its age-old

dance with deadening entropy, nature strives to

become more conscious and alive. Atoms become

molecules become amino acid chains become cells

become organisms become, well, civilization. It's

no secret io anyone who has gone online, on a

vision quest, into psychedelic space, a meditative

journey (or even onto the pages of Magical Blend)

that the next obvious evolutionary step is for

human beings to coordinate, somehow, into a single "meta"-being. Thats the whole human struggle: to find group awareness, but without losing

what we cherish as "individual" awareness.

As a culture, we are predisposed to resist

rhe chaotic nature of the real world. The stories

on which we have been raised for the past several centuries reduce the complexity of the

human experience to oversimplified moral platirudes and determinist certainties. We have

become addicted to stories with endings. It is

rhe only way we know to relieve the tension of

nor knowing. We so crave definitive endings

char millions of fundamentalists worldwide

would rather the entire planet be consumed in

a fiery apocalypse than simply let it keep going.

We'd rather be eternally damned and get the

relief of an ending to the story than live on in

existential uncertainty. We refuse to accept the

alternative to completion: change. This is why

fundamentalists are so opposed to the notion of

evolution. Evolution changes the ground rules.

Technology and media have never really been apart from nature. Nothing ever has.

Our power plants are no less natural than a

beaver's dam. Our chemicals are no less natural than bees' honey. We just fooled ourselves

into thinking we had devised a way to resist

the ebb and flow of nature. We were really just

serving its greater agenda.

Living in the free-form chaotic realm of

cyberspace is what awakened me to the underlying rhythms of our world and the urge of all people towards greater connectedness. Most importantly, it's what made me realize I'm part of a

great shift from allegiance to self-expression,

metaphor to recapitulation, fundamentalism to

globalism, apocalypse to evolution, and artificially imposed certainty to the unpredictable impermanence of real life. It has gotten me back in

touch with the underlying rhythms of nature and

the great planetary quest for shared consciousness.
