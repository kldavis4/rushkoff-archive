IF TODAY'S MARKETERS GET THEIR WAY, by the year 2010 we will no longer have a separate, classifiable human activity known as _shopping_. We won't think of ourselves as engaging in shopping any more than we now think of ourselves as engaging in circulating our blood, or complying with gravity. That's right: The object of the game for the next century's marketers will be to make the process of shopping and payment absolutely invisible.

The communications infrastructure we know and love--the Internet--is just the testing ground for the completely self-regulating and self-sustaining marketing engine of tomorrow. Sticky Web sites will be remembered as the quaint and primitive equivalent of flypaper once the true power of e-commerce is effectively tapped.

The only reason the scenarios I'm about to depict have not yet been carried out is that advertisers and technologists have not yet joined forces. Ad folk are still desperately attempting to justify their own existence in a mediaspace where advertising has no place, and technologists are too shortsighted to see past their own IPOs or exit strategies.

But as business plans evolve to match the sophistication of the technologies they justify, we will begin to see alliances between marketers and engineers. And

when this happens, look out. The psy- chology underlying consumption will be turbocharged beyond our ability to under- stand or regulate it. Our computer pro- grams and networks will guide human behavior toward the single end of buying more stuff more rapidly. They will have been designed and built by us to do so. Everything else be damned.

The first thing to disappear from the marketer's arsenal will be advertising. Although it has served a useful purpose up until now, why should anyone want to publicize the fact that an object or service needs to be actually purchased? The suc- cessful marketers of the 21st century will be the ones who get us to buy things we don't even know we're buying. Besides, why let customers see you pay money to middlemen when you could be paying all that money directly to them?

This is why advertising will be replaced by positioning. Instead of extolling the ethereal "brand images" of products in expensive television commercials, mar- keters will hand over their budgets direct- ly to consumers in the form of kickbacks. They will simply pay consumers to buy their products. We already see the begin- nings of such policies in alliances through which airlines give frequent- flier miles to credit-card users, who also earn discounts on long-distance charges. The Internet gives companies the abili- ty to create much larger networks of alliances. The customer need only choose which cartel of providers to subscribe to, and everything else-telephone, utili- ties, tolls, cable TV, online trading-will be provided, paid for, and processed automatically through a single electron- ic account.

■Demographics and psychographics will no longer be necessary, because there will be no need to appeal to more than one person at a time. Currently, market- ing research techniques seek to identify "target markets" as a way of lumping hundreds of millions of consumers into more easily manageable and under- standable groups. Thirty-five-year-old

businessmen over 6 feet tall are more likely to go to certain kinds of movies, for example, and 65-year-old widows west of Wyoming are more likely to purchase a detergent that smells a certain way.

But these generalizations were invent- ed as a way of creating marketing mes-

WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR...

MEDIA

Ψήσιος

OVER THE PAST DECADE Currently, about one-third of Net surfers regularly read online magazines and newspapers, according to Jim Nail of For- rester Research. But owners of print publications aren't worried, mainly because of the bus-and-bathroom factor (i.e., portability). And the profession itself has boomed: In the past 10 years, journalists' salaries have risen 46 percent-an increase larger than that seen in almost any other profession-as more and more news outlets have appeared online and as reporting on technology and business assumed new importance.

OVER THE NEXT DECADE Personalization sites and other "editorial aggregators" will continue to grow, helping readers to get all their news at a sin- gle stop. Streaming media-radio, TV, and beyond-will prosper. And in an effort to compete with their online counterparts, most print publications will feature tear- away sheets that serve as quick-reference summaries of the contents. Will paid online magazines ever see the light of day? "Not in the current form," says Erim Sinriche of Jupiter Communications. How will publications turn a profit, then? Probably by aggressively developing and marketing such premium services as an investment-advice area sponsored by a financial magazine, or bonus statistics managed by a sports weekly.

sages that could arouse people's interest with greater specificity than a nation- wide shotgun approach. Computers have the processing power to keep separate records of each consumer. Dynamic Web site configuration programs will be able to build customized pages in real time that induce the greatest number of pur- chases from each individual human being. If light-blue pages with Buy but- tons along the left side or offers in which the price ends in 87 cents tend to make you buy more, then that's what the com- puters will settle on—until your predilec-

tions change.

oven, grocery cart, and pacemaker. The more our behaviors are understood, the more easily they can be tweaked and adjusted to yield more buying.

Our machines and networks are

already in the process of being tuned to make us buy more things, regardless of whether we need or even want them. All this is being justified as a way to make our lives easier and more fun. At least it's bound to keep the Internet-speculation bubble afloat for another few years.

While I won't presume to judge whether the computerization of mar- keting in the coming century is a good or a bad thing, I'd like to ask the designers of the automated consumption engine not to forget one potentially very impor- tant feature: a way to turn it off.
