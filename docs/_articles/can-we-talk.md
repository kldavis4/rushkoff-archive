_The Jerusalem Report_ called him an atheist because he is an iconoclast, but then, the writer who was so supremely critical of this young, 42-year old deep thinker, Douglas Rushkoff, obviously doesn't understand the second of the Ten Commandments. Jews are the original iconoclasts. That's why everyone else hates them--for that and providing the world with the rest of the Ten Commandments. But people don't get it. Douglas Rushkoff, author of _Nothing is Sacred_, does get Judaism, very, very well. And because he does, more and more institutional Jews and Jewish institutions see him as a threat to their well-being.

Why? Because he asks good, hard questions and understands that we might not like what happens when we get the answers. As anyone who ever read or saw _Yentl_ knows, you are judged by the questions you ask. Many of us know from our own Hebrew School and yeshiva experiences that we really aren't supposed to ask questions, because a) our teachers (rabbis) might not have the answers; b) they don't want you to know the answers, or c) they are afraid of the answers. It seems they want to be the exclusive holders of the supreme knowledge and interpretation of the Torah.

In _Nothing is Sacred_, Rushkoff dares to question some basic assumptions about contemporary Judaism. His questions are based primarily on the Rambam (Maimonides), whose books were burned when they were first published and from whence a rabbinical decree forbidding the study of Greek philosophy was issued. The questions Rushkoff raises have nothing to do with apostasy, atheism or anti-Zionism. He just examines the roots of Judaism, the Torah, the Talmud, the rabbinical writings of the past and does nothing out of the ordinary. He asks some real, hard questions--questions the Rambam and other great sages have raised in the past before there were European pogroms and a Holocaust that somehow turned Judaism upside down.

1:,ooks on cyberspace and the

knows about interaction and intercon-

nectivity. He writes for the New Yark

Tmies, Tmie and other "hot" publications

on that subject. He is astonished at the

heat and rage his words have engendered.

Q. How did upbringing and child-

A: l grew up watching television in the

I 960s and '70s. Even as a child, I could see

the reality depicted in the tube differed

greatly from the world outside. What both-

Walter Cronkite ended his broadcasts with

the assertion ''That's the way it is." What an

outrageous statement! And most Americans

believed it. He probably did himself.
