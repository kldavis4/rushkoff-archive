_The Jerusalem Report_ called him an atheist because he is an iconoclast, but then, the writer who was so supremely critical of this young, 42-year old deep thinker, Douglas Rushkoff, obviously doesn't understand the second of the Ten Commandments. Jews are the original iconoclasts. That's why everyone else hates them--for that and providing the world with the rest of the Ten Commandments. But people don't get it. Douglas Rushkoff, author of _Nothing is Sacred_, does get Judaism, very, very well. And because he does, more and more institutional Jews and Jewish institutions see him as a threat to their well-being.

Why? Because he asks good, hard questions and understands that we might not like what happens when we get the answers. As anyone who ever read or saw _Yentl_ knows, you are judged by the questions you ask. Many of us know from our own Hebrew School and yeshiva experiences that we really aren't supposed to ask questions, because a) our teachers (rabbis) might not have the answers; b) they don't want you to know the answers, or c) they are afraid of the answers. It seems they want to be the exclusive holders of the supreme knowledge and interpretation of the Torah.

In _Nothing is Sacred_, Rushkoff dares to question some basic assumptions about contemporary Judaism. His questions are based primarily on the Rambam (Maimonides), whose books were burned when they were first published and from whence a rabbinical decree forbidding the study of Greek philosophy was issued. The questions Rushkoff raises have nothing to do with apostasy, atheism or anti-Zionism. He just examines the roots of Judaism, the Torah, the Talmud, the rabbinical writings of the past and does nothing out of the ordinary. He asks some real, hard questions--questions the Rambam and other great sages have raised in the past before there were European pogroms and a Holocaust that somehow turned Judaism upside down.

The reaction to his book has been extraordinary. Rarely has a Jewish author been so excoriated, mostly by people who have only read the reviews and read "bites" that have been taken out of context. Many of them have anthropomorphized God into an old man with a long white beard, micromanaging the Universe and toting up brownie points. Many Jews have forgotten that whatever you think God is, that is what God is NOT. That's why there is a second commandment, and that's why Jews are the original iconoclasts. There shall be no graven images before you--not even in your mind's eye.

Rushkoff is mostly known for his books on cyberspace and the media. He, better than most, knows about interaction and interconnectivity. He writes for the _New York Times_, _Time_ and other "hot" publications on that subject. He is astonished at the heat and rage his words have engendered. Obviously, when Douglas Rushkoff quotes Joan Rivers and asks, "Can We Talk?" the answer is, "Absolutely not," prompting the question ''Why?" Perhaps the answers to that lie in the Q&A below, conducted by Ken Applebaum.

Q. How did your upbringing and childhood influence your adult perspectives on media and faith?

A: l grew up watching television in the 1960s and '70s. Even as a child, I could see the reality depicted in the tube differed greatly from the world outside. What bothered me were the endings. ln the news, Walter Cronkite ended his broadcasts with the assertion ''That's the way it is." What an outrageous statement! And most Americans believed it. He probably did himself.

Meanwhile, sitcoms and one-hour dramas strain to resolve their conflicts before time is up. lt didn't seem to matter that Lucy deceived Ricky for 20 television minutes, or that Fred Flintstone lied to his wife, only that the situation found some technical, plot-driven resolution. TV presented a closed American-driven universe, with very particular rules. It encouraged us to look forward to endings, and to accept the endings we were given--it seemed to make them believe the stories of their lives were already written.

Because of the dissatisfaction I experienced with media and because I love to dissect how it is all put together, I welcomed the age of interactive media with great excitement. I saw it as the process through which people would tell their own stories and develop their own narratives, rather than absorbing srories presented by sponsors. I hoped our society would be less addicted to the certainty of conclusions.

As a youth, I never took Judaism very seriously as a faith-based religion. I suppose I believed that Abraham and those mythic Biblical characters did exist--in the same way that I believed that pro-wrestling was real. That probably went on until I was about 11 years old. We belonged to a boring Refonn congregation that had more to do with Zionism and the preservation of upper middle class suburban values than it did with Judaism. I remember one of our rabbis (subsequently fired) told us that, "God is your conscience." I liked that. I tended not to have any faith, because I was coming into consciousness as Nixon resigned and no one had faith anymore.

_Rushkoff attended Princeton and majored in English and pre-med, then earned his Master's in Fine Arts in Theater and Film . He gave up theater as a method of getting people to act, because he felt it was too didactic. He tutored kids for their SATs, wrote some screenplays and turned to books. It wasn 't a career move; it was simply that he sought venues where he could express his ideas and explain the technology that changed all our lives. He was a pioneer writing about the lnternet for the mainstream press in the '80s, explaining what we thought was the nerds' revenge to the rest of us. His first book was_ Cyberia_. He told Applebaum:_

Silicon Valley was filled with Deadheads, ravers and other radically psychedelic people. I thought computer people were nerds, not freaks. What was there about the technology that excited chem so? They designed the new interfaces--the new realities--and were the only people with significant experience navigating hallucinatory realms. There was a single cultural shift taking place across a disparate range of fields and disciplines. No one had quite put their finger on it, but people accepted the fact that our realities are designed and can be redesigned. Kids working in math, physics, music, electronics, networking, holography, rave, fantasy role-playing, even eco-terrorism, were all coming up with the same basic insight, but thought it was exclusively theirs. I wrote _Cyberia_ to let everyone know about that shift.

Q: What enduring lesson or perspective did you take from Cyberia?

A: I learned that no matter how autonomous a new technology or technique might make us, some people still long for power and others long for charismatic leaders. Look at the Jewish Renewal movement as a case study... But the problem with the rave/Internet culture was that it had no coherent set of values, just the notion that we can redesign reality. It was like the '60s, but without the policies. Ravers--the ones coherent enough to express big ideas--spoke of having no agenda. And this made them ripe for the picking.

This resulted in a fictionalization of _Cyberia_, called _The Ecstacy Club_.

_Ecstasy Club_ is about a social experiment gone awry, about a rave club turning slowly into a cult. Countercultural movements remain countercultural by continually defining themselves against the status quo, but this is a losing proposition because it causes extremism. In _The Ecstasy Club_, the group of kids keeps repositioning itself in order to remain counter-cultural and different, and so it goes nuts. They don't realize that the tools for change are right in front of them. It doesn't take a strange attractor (from chaos math) or an alien visitation to make change.

Q: Media Virus! \[another Rushkoff book\] explores many of the memes contained in mass media. What are memes and why do we, as consumers of media, need to be more aware of them?

A: Memes are a way of talking about ideas that are less efficient than they are worth. All people need to know is that different ideas are streaming at them through media all the time. The ideas that nest themselves best in our brains and replicate like viruses are the ones that exploit our weaknesses. Ideas spread through the media safely, sometimes because they are hidden in seemingly innocuous media, like kids' shows. This a good thing because it allows for some very progressive notions to spread for a good long time--like in _The Simpsons_, which is filled with great ideas, encased in comic shells, but it can also be deadly.

I'm concerned that we are being fed messages. People should know that most media is designed to make you feel bad, so that you regress to a childlike state and transfer parental authority onto the sponsor. You are more vulnerable to messages when you feel really bad or when you feel artificially high (like at a Promisekeepers or Amway rally). The main message of the mainstream media is: The world is dangerous and mean; you are not worthy. You are alone. Nobody loves you and nobody will, unless you do what we tell you.

Q: Last year, Exit Strategy was published. It seems couched in media, the Internet, marketing and society's burgeoning potential. However, it is also the Biblical tale of Joseph and deals with "born-again" Jews, "lapsed" Jews, the growing disparity between the observant and the secular segments of Jewish culture and subtle forms of anti-semitism or, more properly, systems designed to favor an incumbent, more gentile power structure. Is this novel a bridge between two phases in your writing career or sign of a departure?

A: My books aren't bridges because I don't plan out my writing career. Using the story of Joseph as an apt allegory, _Exit Strategy_ looks at how the application of the underlying ethics of the Jewish system could prevent the kind of insanity that we went through at the end of the 1990s. Those years were about market fascism and that has occurred many times before--always with the same result. It is a parable for how we release ourselves from mental bondage, from the slavery of worshiping an idolatrous system like the stock market.

_Nothing is Sacred_ isn't a departure from media theory at all. Judaism is a medium. The mistake of Internet business people--the same ones I satirized in _Exit Strategy_--was to think that "content is king." It never was. _Contact_ is king in an interactive environment. Judaism was invented at the height of idolatrous civilization to make the point: get rid of the gods so that people can come into contact with one another.

Q: In Nothing is Sacred: The Truth

About Judaism, the original subtitle

was to be "The Case For Open Source

Judaism ." Your website is www.open-

sourcejudai sm.com. What does

"open source" mean, and how are 1\~e

to apply that concept to what man)

see as undeniable truths?

A: Open source is a term borrowed

from computer software de\\'elopment.

People using software should ha\\·e the

ability to change and improve it. The code

is not locked down or kept secret; it is open

to everyone to rework and evolve. I belie\\·e

religions should be thought of in this way,

too. At least Judaism should, because

Judaism was invented as an altemative to

the pagan religions of its day. People rrayed

to gods for stuff-fertility, rain, sun ... We

were children, depending on the whims of

the gods. We measured time with a circular

calendar, because there was no concept of

progress. We couldn't make thing:;

better-things stayed the same, and gt't

momentarily better or worse because 0f the

gods' moods. .

Judaism was invented as a way for

human beings to take an active role in their

own existence. We believe in the one G,-1. -·ble but we understand that we are resroru1

for what happens on this planer, in this uni·

verse, in our lives. Instead of understanding
