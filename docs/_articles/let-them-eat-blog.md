Finally it's becoming practical for people with little or no technical expertise whatsoever to find their voice.

Now we just need ways to make sure we know how to hear them....¹

\--Tom Coates (2003)

Finding people with similar interests to yourself can be a challenging experience. Finding out how to communicate effectively with people of similar interests has been an ongoing challenge. In spite of the promise of new technologies acting as an agora for political debate and cyberdemocracy in the fashion documented by Mark Poster,² the realities of bandwidth scarcity, the intellectual property issues associated with posting rich media content, and a user-oriented need for maximum communication with minimum time wastage have meant that the vast majority of communications between people online are text-based . And the nature of text-based communications is such that the practice of communicating ideas and cultures becomes a frustrating process of negotiating meaning and searching for synergy. This could well be a reason why blogs have been so successful at defining new cultures for the sharing of ideas. Dominated by text (in spite of the growth of moblogging, picture, and vidblogging--on the latter, see chapter nineteen by Adrian Miles in this volume), text-based blogs allow for conversations and cultures to develop in an almost evolutionary fashion, growing and changing in accordance with reader interests and influences. Thus it is blogs that come closest to achieving the vision for cyberspace first promulgated by advocates of technocracies--cyber-utopias for cultural expansion, political debate, and economic efficiency. Blogs provide us with the basis for developmg the triple crown of "faster, cheaper, better"; information of interest to any specific community is available on the fly, at almost zero cost for all members of a community, and with more reliability and cross-referencing than was ever before available. In terms of modern cultural development, blogs may well be the source of the communication renaissance.

This chapter demonstrates the power of blogs as a means of constructing and negotiating ideas. Excerpts from blog posts by Douglas Rushkoff have been interspersed with commentary by _Uses of Blogs_ co-editor Joanne Jacobs.

**The Communications Renaissance**

» Douglas Rushkoff--Renaissance Now? (13 June 2002)³

The birth of the Internet era was considered a revolution, by many. My best friends--particularly those in the 'counterculture'--saw in the lnternet an opportunity to topple the storytellers who had dominated our politics, economics, society, and religion, in short our very reality, and to replace their stories with ones of our own. It was a beautiful and exciting sentiment, but one as based in a particular narrative as any other. Revolutions simply replace one story with another. The capitalist narrative is replaced by the communist; the religious fundamentalist's for the agnostic's. The means may be different, but the rewards are the same, as is the exclusivity of their distribution. That's why they're called revolutions; we're just going in a circle.

I prefer to think of the proliferation of interactive media as an opportunity for renaissance: a moment when we have the opportunity to step out of the story, altogether. Renaissances are historical instances of widespread recontextualization. People in a variety of different arts, philosophies, and sciences have the ability to reframe their reality. Quite literally, renaissance means "rebirth." It is the rebirth of old ideas in a new context. A renaissance is a dimensional leap, when our perspective shifts so dramatically that our understanding of the oldest, most fundamental elements of existence changes.

Take a look back at what we think of as the original Renaissance--the one we were taught in school. What were the main leaps in perspective? Well, most obviously, perspective painting itself. Artists developed the technique of the "vanishing point" and with it the ability to paint three dimensional representations on two-dimensional surfaces. The character of this innovation is subtle, but distinct. It is not a technique for working in three dimensions; it is not that artists moved from working on canvas to working with clay. Rather, perspective painting allows an artist to relate between dimensions. It is a way of representing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane.

Likewise, calculus--another innovation developed not quite during, but immediately in the wake of Renaissance advances--is a mathematical system that allows us to derive one dimensional perspective from another. Most simply, it is a new way of describing curves with the language of lines, spheres with the language of curves, or speed in the language of distance. The leap from arithmetic to calculus was not just a leap in our ability to relate the objects of one dimension to the objects of another. It was a shift in perspective that allowed us to orient ourselves to mathematical objects from beyond the context of their own dimensionality.

The other main features of the Renaissance permitted similar shifts in perspective. Circumnavigation of the globe changed our relationship to the planet we live on and the maps we used to describe it. The maps still worked, of course--only they described a globe instead of a plane. Anyone hoping to navigate a course had to be able to relate a two-dimensional map to the new reality of a three-dimensional planet. Similarly, the invention of moveable type and the printing press changed the relationship of author and audience to text. The creation of a manuscript was no longer a one-pointed affair. Well, the creation of the first manuscript still was--but now it could be replicated and distributed to everyone, It was still one story, but now it was subject to a multiplicity of individual perspectives. This lattermost innovation, alone, changed the landscape of religion in the Western world. Individual interpretation of the Bible led to the collapse of Church authority and of the unilateral nature of its decrees. Everyone demanded his or her own relationship to the story.

In all these cases, people experienced a very particular shift in their relationship to and understanding of dimensions. Understood this way, a renaissance is a moment of reframing. We step out of the frame as it is currently defined, and see the whole picture in a new context. We can then play by new rules.

The great Renaissance was a simple leap in perspective. Instead of seeing everything in one dimension, we came to realize there was more than one dimension on which things were occurring. Even the Elizabethan world picture, with its concentric rings of authority--God, king, man, animals--reflects this newfound way of contending with the simultaneity of action of many dimensions at once.

The evidence of today's renaissance is at least as profound as that of the one that went before. The 16th century saw the successful circumnavigation of the globe via the seas. The 20th century saw the successful clrcumnavigation of the globe from space. The first pictures of earth from space changed our perspective on this sphere, forever. In the same century, our dominance over the planet was confirmed not just through our ability to travel around it, but to destroy it. The atomic bomb (itself the result of a rude dimensional interchange between submolecular particles) gave us the ability to destroy the globe. Now, instead of merely being able to circumnavigate "God's" creation, we could actively destroy it. This is a new perspective.

We also have our equivalent of perspective painting, in the invention of the holograph. The holograph allows us to represent not just three, but four dimensions on a two-dimensional plate. When the viewer walks past a holograph, she can observe the three-dimensional object over a course of time. A bird can flap its wings in a single picture. But, more importantly for our renaissance's purposes, the holographic plate itself embodies a new renaissance principle. When the plate is smashed into hundreds of pieces, we do not find that one piece contains the bird's wing, and another piece the bird's beak. No, each piece of the plate contains an image of the entire subject, albeit a faint one. When the pieces are put together, the image achieves greater resolution. But each piece contains a representation of the totality--a leap in dimensional understanding that is now informing disciplines as diverse as brain anatomy and computer programming.

Our analog to calculus is the development of systems theory, chaos math, and the much-celebrated fractal. Confronting non-linear equations on their own terms for the first time, mathematicians armed with computers are coming to new understandings of the way numbers can be used to represent the complex relationships between dimensions. Accepting that the surfaces in our world, from coastlines to clouds, exhibit the properties of both two- and three-dimensional objects (just what is the surface area of a cloud?) they came up with ways of working with and representing objects with fractional dimensionality. Using fractals and their equations, we can now represent and work with objects from the natural world that defied Cartesian analysis. We also become able to develop mathematical models that reflect many more properties of nature's own systems--such as self-similarity and remote high leverage points. Again, we find this renaissance characterized by the ability of an individual to reflect, or even affect, the grand narrative. To write the game.

Finally, our renaissance's answer to the printing press is the computer and its ability to network. Just as the printing press gave everyone access to readership, though, the computer and Internet give everyone access to authorship. The first Renaissance took us from the position of passive recipient to active interpreter. Our current renaissance brings us from a position of active interpretation to one of authorship. We are the creators.

**Blog Cultures**

So if we accept Rushkoff s premise of the present renaissance mimicking

that of the previous Renaissance, how does our ability to create and to control

our environments relate to the development of the blog? Many have argued

that the growth of the blog is a revolution or at least major restructuring of

mainstream media: that blogs are a powerful alternative news source and provide an effective check against the mass oligopolization of media organizations

and concomitant reduction in content diversity.4 But given the growth rates

and decidedly personal nature of the majority of new blogs,5 it's probably more

significant that biogs represent the current renaissance' s version of crosscultural exchange. Safer and more efficient than circumnavigating the globe in

either tall ships or spacecraft, blogs still allow for debate, exchange, and speculation between strangers, and the growth of new friendships, business deals,

and partnerships that might never otherwise have been forged.

The rise of biogs as a medium for the creators of the modern communications renaissance has permitted an almost meteoric development of very specific cultural groups. Elsewhere in this edition are chapters focusing on niche

blogging groups, but the culture of blogging itself has arisen as a key niche

market. Celebrity bloggers are now a cult in their own right with "A-list" identities such as Cory Doctorow, Meg Hourihan, Joi Ito, Ja\~on Kottke, Glen\~

Reynol\~s, and Douglas Rushkoff (among many others) attracting major audiences simply because they are blogging. It helps, of course, to have a book or

two u

nd

_er your belt to promote the image, but the act of blogging and the cult

of bloggmg have produced their own unique market niche.

But eventually the power of the media as a vehicle fo r the public voice and

perceived value of investigative journalism waned after the \\Xlas h.irigton Post's

David Weinberger has explored some of this territory m his work, describing

the conversations erupting online through the vehicle of blogs and other social

software tools as "small pieces, loosely joined,"7 but it's worth exploring just

how loosely these "pieces" of data-news, cultural content creation, business

idea generation, legal mediation, learning facilitation, and so on-are joined.

Since the release of blogging software at the turn of the millennium, blogs

have simply replaced older "home pages" of technology advocates and netizens

alike. As the technology itself evolved, and articulate pioneer bloggers began to

list "blogrolls" of other bloggers they read and advocated, and concepts like

Friendster and Live\]ournal' s Friends networks developed, there emerged-almost

by accident-blog communities. Very quickly, a power law distribution of blog

popularity emerged, and the significance of some blogs dramatically overshadowed the majority.8 This did not mean that new blogs were prevented from rising to prominence-there have been several instances of blogs that have grown

in influence over time-but the development of a hierarchy of blog significance

did emerge, and syndicates of bloggers achieved a degree of influence approaching that of mainstream media. Gill cautioned that any attempt to measure the specific influence of blogs (based on links and audience numbers) is

inherently flawed, because the competing methodologies for calculating these

linkages and audiences are so complex. She also notes that other research

questions about the relative influence of cross-linking through direct in-blog

references as opposed to blogrolls, as well as the frequency of blog entries and

first-mover advantage of early bloggers, will all impact on any degree of influence. But she also concludes that regardless of these measurement issues, there

is no doubt that certain "A-list" biogs are so influential that they spawn other

blog discussions and create a pyramid structure of influence. 9

So while the functionality and power of negotiation inherent to biogs may

well be providing us with a new perspective and a new means of understanding th

r ;-Douglas Rushkoff- The Real Threat of Biogs (5 Sep. 2004) 10 :

I believe that the most dangerous thing about biogs to the status quo is that so many

i of them exist for reasons other than to make money. A thriving community of people

' who are engaged for free, to me, have a certain authority that people doing things for

money don't.

Writing a book for money is always suspect. (Disclosure to all: I have written books for

I money and for free.) Writing it for free is very different-and might still be suspect, but

for other reasons.

: What made the early Internet so very threatening to the mainstream media was not

just the new opinions being expressed, but the fact that people were spending hours

of their lives doing something that didn't involve production or consumption in the

traditional market sense. Families with Internet connections were watching an average

, of nine hours less commercial programming each week.

, The threat of rave culture was that it was an alternative economy. The kids were no

I longer \~oing to the mob-run nightclubs, the police weren't getting their cut, and the

1 liquor distributors weren't making any money. Those of us involved in rav\~r at least

· many of US-<lidn't realize that's why they were such a threat.

I LikeWi\~, I believe the greatest power of the blog is not just its ability to distribute

. alternative information-a great power, indeed-but its power to demonstrate a mode

of engagement that is not based on the profit principle.

Ad .

market-free if at all possible. Even if it means getting a day jo\~, which many of us have

done in order to support our work. I have been very lucky in my ability to craft rn

messages into forms that publishers will pay for. But the m\~re integrity I get (and th\~

more market-driven the book industry gets) the harder that 1s to do. Indeed, the book

industry used to use criteria other than marketability in picking what to publish.

Sometimes, editors would publish books that only broke even, because they

happened to like them. Those editors are few and far between, now, because they

don't make as much money for their companies, and the values have changed.

Conclusions

There is growing debate over business models for blogging, with the commercial sector keen to consider means of profiting from the blogging act. Of

course, this business focus has spawned much concern among blogging "purists" about the effects of blog advertising on the validity of blogs as a source of

critical debate. However, Rushkoffs discussion above is not focused on advertisements in blogs, but on the power of blogging as an activity which is largely

disengaged from commercial media. Rushkoffs notion of the real threat of

blogs goes some way toward alleviating the potential problems that could arise

from a growing centralization (or fragmentation) of voices. If the real "threat"

of blogging is its challenge to mainstream media as a nonprofit activity, then a

very old problem arises: how do businesses access consumers in an age of content generation by the people and for the people? Any fragmentation of voices

occurring in the blogosphere will be secondary to the primary concern of sales

and marketing for commercial players. If blogs threaten audience sizes and

types for mainstream media, then the pricing of advertising for media will decline, and costs of production for advertising-supported media will consequently rise. Businesses will seek out new ways of accessing audiences either

through Google-esque search engine and context-specific Website advertising,

or through some other manner of contextual information aggregation.

This threat is real and palpable for businesses today. Research is being

conducted on new models for television and interactive media advertising

across the globe precisely because businesses still need a means of providing

information about products and services to potential consumers. And as blog_s

inherently provide content that audiences find engaging and interesting, b\~stnesses are also considering how they can use blogs as a vehicle for accesstng

those highly specialized audiences. ·

Chris Anderson has explored this in his ideas about "the Long Tail": an

entertainment or content industry that is characterized by millions of niche

markets at the "shallow end of the bitstream." 11 Blogs fit perfectly into this t\~eory of business development, because they respond so dynamically to e

and contributing to other blogs. Thus, blogs are uniquely suited to business

development in the "long tail," because blogs are content vehicles for niche

interests, and bloggers have the digitial capital that businesses seek.

The trouble with this emergence of blogging as a facilitator for business is

that what Rushk

off describes as the "real threat" of blogs begins to weaken as

blogs for

ally or informally adopt business models for connecting businesses

with potential consumers. And with highly specialized business markets erupting in the "long tail," the threat of blogs as non-profit ventures declines, and

market segmentation-and fragmentation of perspectives-once again rises.

We're left wondering what kind of communication renaissance has really

emerged, and who are the greatest beneficiaries of the blogging revolution.
