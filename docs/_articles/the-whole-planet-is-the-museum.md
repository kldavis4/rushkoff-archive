I met Genesis in the early '90s in the Bay Area. He needed a lift to Timothy Leary's house in Beverly Hills, and I needed an interview for a book I was writing about viral media. We spent about six hours in the car together, trying to impress one another with our strangest thoughts while Gen's two daughters fought in the back seat.

We've been friends ever since.

I guess it's about ten years later, now. I've gotten married, become an author and university professor, while Gen has been kicked out of the UK forever, gotten divorced and married again, replaced his teeth with gold ones, and done some other stuff to his body that I'd be scared to. Still, in spite of our outward differences, we're on the same path, and often use one another for guidance along the way.
