A guy goes to the doctor, complaining of terrible tapeworm. He's tried every known remedy, but to no avail. The doctor tells him not to worry--just to come back the next day with three bananas and a cookie. The man is perplexed, but he has faith in the doctor's fine reputation and returns the next day as he has been instructed. The doctor asks the man to pull down his pants and bend over. He then proceeds to insert the three bananas, one by one, into the man's rectum. He waits for one minute, then inserts the cookie.

The doctor tells the man to return every day for two weeks, and every day he does the same thing: insert the three bananas, wait one minute, and then insert the cookie. On the last day, the doctor tells his patient to return once more, with three bananas and a hammer. While the man cringes at the thought of having to take in a hammer, he dutifully returns with the requested items.

The doctor inserts the three bananas as before, and waits a full minute. The poor patient is trembling with fear. But the doctor just holds the hammer and waits a minute more. After the third minute, the tapeworm appears from the man's rectum, asking "where's my cookie?" Wham! Down comes the hammer on the tapeworm's head.

The tapeworm is us: a culture so addicted to endings that we 'd rather die in an all-consuming apocalypse than let the human story continue in uncertainty. There are bumper stickers in the Midwest United States proclaiming "In case of rapture, this car will be empty." The passengers are looking forward to the end of the world! We like conclusions, certainty, finality. It is how we have been trained.

For all our heartfelt concern about the younger generation's apathy and disconnectedness, they may just be a few steps ahead of us at coping with the uncertainty and inconclusiveness of our chaotic age. They are native in a hyper-mediated, electronic world where most adults are mere immigrants. Rather than despair at their seemingly mindless past-times--from video games to _Beavis and Butthead_--we might rather look to what these activities offer young people, the folks I call "screenagers", to help them make sense of the bizarre world around them. For it is our youngsters who are immune to the conditioning of television and its sponsors, and our young people who may be able to break the hypnotic spell that the rest of us are under.

We call the stuff on television "programming" for a reason. No, television programmers are not programming television sets or evening schedules; they're programming the viewers. Whether they are convincing us to buy a product. vote for a candidate, adopt an ideology, or simply confirm a moral platitude, the underlying reason for making television is to hold onto our attention and then sell us a bill of goods.

Since the time of the Bible and Aristotle through to today's over-determined three-act action movies, the best tool at the programmer's disposal has been the story. But, thanks to technologies like the remote, the joystick, and the mouse, it just doesn't work any more. The traditional story works by bringing the audience into a state of tension. The storyteller creates a character we like, and gets us lo identify with the hero's plight. Then the character is put into jeopardy of one sort or another. As the character moves up the incline plane towards crisis, the audience follows him vicariously, while taking on his anxiety as their own. Helplessly we follow him into danger, disease or divorce, and just when we can't take any more tension without bursting, our hero finds a way out. He finds a moral, a product, an agenda or a strategy that rescues him, and us his audience, from the awful anxiety. The higher the level of tension the programmer has been able to create, the more preposterous the hero's critical twist can get. Shirley MacLaine is only granted a minor insight in _Terms of Endearment_, while Arnold Schwarzenegger has the luxury of breathing on Mars in _Total Recall_.

But whatever solution the character finds, the audience must swallow it, too. Along with it, we swallow the sponsor or filmmaker's agenda. This is what it means to "enter-tain"-- literally "to hold within"--and it only works on a captive audience. In the old days of television, when a character would walk into danger and take the audience up into uncomfortable anxiety, it would have taken at least fifty calories of human effort for the viewer to walk up to his TV set and change the channel. The viewer was trapped. As long as the programmer did not raise the stakes too abruptly, the passive viewer would remain in his reclining lounge chair and go along for the ride.

The remote control changed all that. With an expenditure of, perhaps, 0.0001 calories, the anxious viewer is liberated from tortuous imprisonment and free to watch another programme. Although most well-behaved adult viewers will soldier on through a story, kids raised with remotes in their hands have much less reverence for well-crafted story arcs, and zap away without a moment's hesitation. Instead of watching one programme, they skim through ten at a time. They do not watch TV, they watch the television, guiding their own paths through the entirety of media rather than following the prescribed course of any one programmer.

No matler how much we complain about our kids' short attention spans, their ability to disconnect from programming has released them from the hypnotic spell of even the best TV mesmerisers. The Nintendo joystick further empowers them while compounding the programmer's dilemma. In the old days, the TV image was unchangeable. Gospel truth piped into the home from the top of some glass building. Today, kids have the experience of manipulating the image on the screen. This has fundamentally altered their perception of and reverence for the television image. Worse yet, the computer mouse and the Internet turn the video monitor into a doorway. No longer just an appliance for passive programming, the monitor is a portal to places and ideas. Kids with camcorders do not even bother to watch programmes. They just make their own.

Screenagers raised with interactive devices in their media arsenals, are native in a mediaspace where even the best television producers are immigrants. They speak the language better, and see through our clumsy attempts to programme them into submission. They never forget for a moment that they are watching media, and resent those of us who try to draw them in and sell them something. We mistake their ironic detachment for cultural apathy. It is not. They do care; they are just unwilling to take on some character's anxiety and then swallow his agendas or buy his products.

Still, they do like TV, and there are ways for commercial programmers and television artists alike to appeal to their screenage sensibilities and viewing habits. In doing so, such programmers will be addressing a cultural agenda rather than foisting an agenda onto culture.

The shows embraced by the screenage generation

accept the inherent discontinuity of the television

medium rather than trying to smooth it out. For example,

while we were all taught in film school how to bridge

the jolt of an edit point, the screenager experiences each

of these paved-over breaks as a lie. It is discontinuity

pretending to be continuous, and it comes across as false.

Where adults are challenged by gaps, kids thrive on

them . Just consider the difference between the

experience of an adult skier and a child snow boarder

descending a slope. The adult, with his long parallel

skis, looks for the smoothest, most powdery path

possible. The kid seeks out the bumps, rocks and patches
