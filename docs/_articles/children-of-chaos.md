A guy goes to the doctor, complaining of terrible tapeworm. He's tried every known remedy, but to no avail. The doctor tells him not to worry--just to come back the next day with three bananas and a cookie. The man is perplexed, but he has faith in the doctor's fine reputation and returns the next day as he has been instructed. The doctor asks the man to pull down his pants and bend over. He then proceeds to insert the three bananas, one by one, into the man's rectum. He waits for one minute, then inserts the cookie.

The doctor tells the man to return every day for two weeks, and every day he does the same thing: insert the three bananas, wait one minute, and then insert the cookie. On the last day, the doctor tells his patient to return once more, with three bananas and a hammer. While the man cringes at the thought of having to take in a hammer, he dutifully returns with the requested items.

The doctor inserts the three bananas as before, and waits a full minute. The poor patient is trembling with fear. But the doctor just holds the hammer and waits a minute more. After the third minute, the tapeworm appears from the man's rectum, asking "where's my cookie?" Wham! Down comes the hammer on the tapeworm's head.

The tapeworm is us: a culture so addicted to endings that we 'd rather die in an all-consuming apocalypse than let the human story continue in uncertainty. There are bumper stickers in the Midwest United States proclaiming "In case of rapture, this car will be empty." The passengers are looking forward to the end of the world! We like conclusions, certainty, finality. It is how we have been trained.

For all our heartfelt concern about the younger

generation's apathy and disconnectedness, they may just

be a few steps ahead of us at coping with the uncertainty

and inconclusiveness of our chaotic age. They are native

in a hyper-mediated, electronic world where most adults

are mere immigrants. Rather than despair at their

seemingly mindless past-times- from video games to

Beavis and Buuhead - we might rather look to what

these activities offer young people, the folks I call

"screenagers", to help them make sense of the bizarre

world around them. For it is our youngsters who are

immune to the conditioning of television and its

sponsors, and our young people who may be able to

break the hypnotic spell that the rest of us are under.
