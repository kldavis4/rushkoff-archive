Back in the late 1990’s, I became interested in the potential of interactive and networking technologies to enhance the potential for democratic and civic participation. I wrote a short book entitled Open Source Democracy (Rushkoff 1998), in which I outlined what I saw as the opportunity for deeper levels of public intervention in not just electoral politics, but ongoing civic affairs.

At the time, most visions of electronically enabled democracy were still stuck in what we might call the Ross Perot phase: use the net to let people vote or participate in what the third-party presidential candidate called “electronic town halls” (Simon, 1992). Perot envisioned citizens watching television programs that informed them about the issues, and then voting yes or no to proposals through their remote controls.

Meanwhile, Clinton pollster Dick Morris (Morris, 2000) (Martinson, 2000) saw in the Internet a new path to polling accuracy. Instead of calling people and asking them questions, Internet pollsters could send emails and monitor existing discussion groups and comments sections. While feedback from users would not directly influence policy, at least lawmakers would be able to gauge (and presumably change messaging in order to influence) public opinion.

My own hope was for a deeper level of participation. Just as the Internet allowed former television viewers to create something very much like programming, the Internet could allow former voters to create something very much like policy platforms. The law might come to resemble less a set of bound volumes than a participatory wiki.

The 2004 Howard Dean campaign was among the first to respond to this call for a more net-enabled democracy. Dean’s campaign manager, Joe Trippi, used the language of open source democracy to energize the first sustained and successful Internet political fundraising campaign. Instead of taking large sums from a small group of donors, Dean drew support from thousands upon thousands of individuals whose donations averaged just $80. Nevertheless, the $50 million Dean raised made him the first presidential candidate to forgo federal matching funds (Trippi, 2004).

Eventually, the Obama campaign followed suit, using Facebook, Twitter, Meetup, forums, and a state-of-the-art website to solicit campaign donations, organize on-the-ground get-out-the-vote activities, and generate peer-to-peer support for his candidacy. He, too, raised enough money to reject federal campaign funds, and managed to leverage the Internet’s metaphorical value as a participatory medium to cast his candidacy as a bottom-up people’s revolution.

However, after Obama won, the stirring idea that “we are the change we have been waiting for” quickly devolved into politics as usual. While Obama the net-enabled campaigner offered many ways for people to get involved by donating money or getting others to donate money, Obama the net-enabled office-holder used the net much less aggressively. The administration offers greater transparency than its predecessors, making it easier for citizens to find pending legislation on the web. But for the most part, it is still a read-only government. The net was used to gather the troops for the campaign, but not to solicit or enable their participation as citizens in an ongoing way. For those who may have risen to the call to “be the change,” (Sullivan, 2008) this was a disappointment.

But the media attention garnered through YouTube-sponsored debates and national net-organized Meetups spurred dozens of pop culture and commercial copycats. Internet-style democracy founds its expression in everything from American Idol (where viewers use text messaging to vote for their favorite singers) to a campaign for Mountain Dew called “Dewmocracy” where consumers campaign for name and color of the next Mountain Dew beverage ofering. (Rushkoff, Life Inc, 2009) This gamification is not an entry point for democratic participation, but rather vulgarizes democracy as some form of consumer decision. Instead of using the net to increase opportunity, engagement, and levels of knowledge, the net seems to be used in the opposite fashion: Internet-style democracy encourages impulsiveness, impatience, siloing, and closed-minded hostility (Pariser, 2011). 

CNN and other news networks now use scientific-looking ‘people meters’ to gauge instantaneous audience responses to candidates’ speeches and debates. A line at the bottom of the screen indicates male and female enthusiasm for whatever a candidate is saying in that moment—as if the immediate reaction and the considered response were one and the same (Goodman, Rushkoff, and Dretzin 2003).

Meanwhile, the amateurization encouraged by the net leads users to believe that access means ability. (Keane, 2007) Just because someone has access to a blog doesn’t mean he or she has the ability to write researched, considered or even logical posts. Since a Wordpress template can now make anyone’s posts appear – at least superficially - as authoritative as anyone else’s, it is up to readers to distinguish between the veracity and sense of diferent voices, including their own.

But in a media environment where sensationalism still trumps sense, the reward for participation is not to gain or share knowledge or insight, but to be credited with hits. Bloggers get attention for saying outrageous things, or linking to those who have. With the tools to publish becoming equated with the skill to write, the amateur is rendered incapable of distinguishing his own off-the-cuff output from the considered, researched, or reported product of trained professionals.

This in turn leads to a misplaced disgust for professional journalism - a sense that those who earn column space in _The New York Times_ or airtime on the _BBC_ don’t offer anything of greater intrinsic value than people posting in the comments sections or un-vetted Tumblr blogs. I have more than once been questioned by college students wanting to know why I should be paid for doing “exactly the same thing” that they are doing for free.

Of course, the notion that no one should be paid for journalism misses the fact that corporations and governments will continue to pay billions to public relations firms and advertising agencies to obfuscate the truth. If society invests nothing in professional journalism, there will be no one left with the time, resources, and ability to deconstruct the fictions, pursue leads, evaluate sources, and confirm facts. (Rushkoff, Nieman, 2010)

Instead, we get an Internet-inspired ontological relativism where everyone’s opinions matter as much as everyone else’s facts. Again, without some discipline and direction – some conscious sense of the structural biases of digital media – the promise of some kind of constructive, open source democracy moves ever further away.

In my own experience, I was scheduled to deliver a talk at an American college and received an email from a young woman who wanted to know whether or not I was a “leftist.” It seems she had been retained by an organization headed by right-wing activist David Horowitz to protest the hiring of leftist speakers and professors at American colleges. (Horowitz, 2006) The young woman had spent a bit of time on my website reading articles, but had yet been unable to ascertain if I was, indeed, a leftist. “Could you just tell me if you are a leftist, so I know whether to protest your appearance?”

I responded that it would be difficult for me to answer. I had read much of Marx and understood the extraction of value from the worker, but I wasn’t convinced that large-scale labor unions were the best vehicle for correcting the wrongs of corporate capitalism. She replied, asking if I could give her a simple “yes or no answer.” I told her “yes and no.” She declined my invitation to appear with me to discuss all this on stage during my appearance.

She was ready to protest based on my binary response, but unprepared to have an extended conversation –even in email – where she could become educated or even just hone and advance her own argument. She wanted something as easy as the Like button on Facebook.

By amplifying the more gamified, amateur, and impulse-driven qualities of the net, e-democracy has not only missed the mark as an opportunity for a more participatory electorate and civic body, but also exacerbated some of the least productive elements of the spectator democracy so many of believed would be obsolesced by the Internet. (McLuhan, Laws, 1992)

While the net may have failed democracy as a tool or platform, it may have succeeded on a more subtle yet ultimately deeper level as a media environment. That is, while the keyboards and websites and blogs and streaming video and social networks actually comprising the Internet may not be directly impacting the ways in which citizens engage in civics, digital technology as a cultural landscape is beginning to have a profound effect on the way people conceive of themselves in relationship to one another and institutions. Most significantly, as I’ll attempt to show in the case of the Occupy Wall Street movement, the net suggests new metaphors and demonstrates new principles that inform a novel amalgam of activist practices.

In short, the “citizen science” now being discussed in many forums and collections like the one in which this chapter appears, is most interesting - and ultimately promising - as a style of inquiry into the ways that the emergence of the net and accompanying changes in the social-scientific paradigm have altered our expectations of agency, participation, and change.

The digital environment, like any other media environment, is embedded with certain values that inform the culture within it. The textual environment encouraged new ways of thinking about accountability (written contracts), human interaction (written law) and even religion (the written Covenant with God – the Torah). (Ong, 2002) (Logan, 1987) The printing press likewise changed the way people related to business (central banking), government (the Enlightenment), and the authority of the Church (personal Bibles and the Protestant reformation). (McLuhan, Gutenberg, 1962)

To parse the impact of the digital environment is a bit more difficult since we are currently living within its effects. I identify four of the most pronouncedconceptual shifts accompanying digitality in order to demonstrate the waysthe Occupy movement has utilized them as central operating principles forits new approach to activism and democratic participation.Feedback and iterationThe first is the notion of feedback. Traditionally, what we think of as feedbackis simply the latent results of particular causes. Farmers plant in one season,

   and get feedback months later in the yield of crop. Plant seed too closetogether, and the crop compete for resources. This data is then incorporatedinto the next year’s planting. Likewise, businesses send a product to marketand then wait for sales reports to determine if the design and marketingwere appropriate or could be improved upon. Each new iteration of plantingor product design was based on the feedback from the one before.In the dawn of the digital era, Cyberneticist Norbert Weiner (Weiner, 1965)saw in feedback a way of developing robots that could instantaneously “feel”and respond to changing conditions in the real world. Just as a thermostatsense the temperature in order to turn a heater on or of, and an elevator“feels” for indicators at each floor instead of attempting to measure thedistance between one floor and another, robots could be taught to rely nomore on their programming than to the things around them. Each piece offeedback could be iterated into the next action.With the help of systems theorists aided by computers (Miller & Page, 2007),much more complex systems could be analyzed in terms of feedback anditeration. The screech one hears when placing a microphone too close to anamplified speaker – what we call feedback – is really just the cyclical loop ofuncontrolled feedback, iterating back to the microphone and again to thespeaker. It is analogous to any of the many chaotic systems from theweather to the stock market that evade the analysis of our normal faculties.

   Computers give us a way to see such systems in terms of their feedback anditeration. Fractals – the paisley graphics churned out by computers – arereally just visualizations of the feedback and iteration of non-linearequations. Their power is in their ability to render previouslyincomprehensible systems in graphics that make sense to the human viewer.As a result, we become more ready to understand feedback as an ongoingphenomenon rather than some occasional event.In politics, for example, feedback used to occur primarily in four-year cycles.The populace would vote for a president, that president would go about hisjob, and then four years later he would get feedback in the form of beinggranted another term or kicked out of office. Pollsters arose to obtainfeedback at tighter intervals, so that a politician could adjust policy (or evenjust his communication about policy) during his term. Digital technology –from live Twitter feeds to realtime peoplemeter results – now allows forinstantaneous feedback. In a digital environment, feedback and iteration foldinto one another.Deconstruction of narrativeLikewise, in a digital environment, narratives no longer work quite like theyused to. Thanks to the remote control, the DVR, the joystick, and the mouse,traditional stories are deconstructed, channel surfed, and fast-forwarded.

   (Rushkof, Playing the Future, 1995) The efects of the Aristolean arc and thehero’s journey alike depended on a captive audience. With escape as closeas the push of a button, audiences of all kinds become intolerant of theanxiety associated with the rising tension of a story.In the deconstructed, cut-and-paste mashup of digital media, the messianic,ends-justify-the-means values of traditional journeys no longer find anenvironment consonant with their value systems. This is the realm ofongoing fantasy role-playing, not tragically terminal heroes. The digitalenvironment is not a place for extended struggles, charismatic leadersfollowed by masses, or winner-takes-all campaigns. The structure of digitalentertainment and problem-solving is less like agonistic play with victors andvanquished than it is like James Carse’s “infinite game” (Carse, 1997) - oneplayed for the sake of play. The object of the game is to keep the game goingas long as possible.PrototypingThis sensibility extends to the third characteristic of the digitalmedia environment, its emphasis on prototyping over product. Theshareware culture of the Internet led to what are known as “public betas” –the release of unfinished software to the public for testing and improvement.As Media Lab director Joichi Ito has explained (Ito, 2011), there’s no pointtesting a product in-house when there’s a willing population of users outthere ready to bang on one’s programs. Besides, there’s no time (see

   feedback and iteration above) to finish a product before seeing how peopleare going to react to it. Better to incorporate feedback into one’s software inan ongoing fashion.The user as producerFourth and finally, the digital environment blurs the boundary between usersand programmers. In a computing environment (unless a program isintentionally and artificially encrypted and protected) one’s level ofparticipation is only limited by his willingness to learn more and dig deeper.One can play music through iTunes, or become a DJ whose selections arelistened to by others. He can go deeper and use Garage Band to make newmusic, or another program to create new instruments for Garage Band. Or hecan learn to program a new kind of music sequencer altogether.Or, as I (Rushkof, Monopoly Money, 2012) and Julian Kücklick(Kücklick,2004) have explored separately, one’s level of participation in any systemcan now be understood through the lens of a programmer or player. One canplay a computer game out of the box; one can learn the “cheat” codes toplay the game on a new level; one can learn to “mod” his own level of thegame; or one can become a programmer and develop his own game. In adigital society, people participate on all these levels, and their limitations areeither voluntary or visibly imposed.

   The Occupy movement bears all four of these characteristics of the digitalmedia environment – and its success may have less to do with anyimmediate goals being met or elections being won than the extent to whichthese values are internalized by politics at large. As an Editor-at-Large forAdbustersmagazine in the 1990’s and later author of the bookLife Inc(Rushkof, Life Inc, 2009), which deconstructed the corporation and soughtnew bottom-up solutions to capitalism, I was at least tangentially involved inlaying some of the groundwork for this movement’s ethos and methodology.When the Occupation was first announced, I decided to remain a distantsupporter – so as not to either take credit for what was going on, or to undulyinfluence a movement of young people who I believed deserved to do this forthemselves. In short, I fully believed the Occupiers would be capable ofplanning and interacting in ways beyond my own ability or foresight.The first time I visited Zucotti Park, during the first week of the Occupation, Ihad originally intended to speak and ofer support. But on my arrival, I sawnot just one but several cultural heroes of the 1960’s through the 1990’s, allpreaching to the assembled activists, or singing songs with guitars, or givinginterviews to the press. From my perspective, these folk figures meant well –but were ultimately usurping the moment from their ideological successors.So instead, I spent that day and several more simply observing theproceedings, asking questions, participating in teach-ins, and keeping myidentity to myself.
