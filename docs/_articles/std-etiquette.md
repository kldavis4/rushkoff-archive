STD Etiquette

I was working my way up her thigh with my lips, just managing to get my tongue beneath the edge of her panties, when I felt her hand on my shoulder.

The touch didn't say "stop," exactly But it definitely wasn't one of those let-me-brace-myself-against-your-shoulders-before-you-make-me-scream touches, either. I could tell she wanted to say something--probably something to do with the nature of our relationship, or another of the many contractual stipulations (binding or specifically non-binding) that seem to precede physical intimacy these days.

"I come with a few added surprises," she said. Her face was turning a bit pink.

I rested my head between her breasts, to assure her of my sustained interest in her body no matter what she was about to say. She pushed me up a bit and off her. This was serious.

"Are you familiar with venereal warts?"

I learned that my lover-to-be had just been treated for

two minuscule and probably viral lesions on her-labia.

They might grow back, but they probably wouldn't, and

they're not really contagious, especially through a rubber, when they're not showing, which-having been

re1noved-they weren't. She'd know after some tests in

a few weeks. Or something like that.

I tried to be cool. My hermetically sealed suburba\~

Jewish upbringing has left me somewhat germophobtc

(my mom still travels with a bottle of Lysol), but I've managed to contain my lingering obsession to bathroom

hygiene and chicken preparation.

"It sounds like it's cured," I said. I didn't want her

to feel contaminated. "At least it's not a life-long nuisance like herpes."

Oops. It turns out that, like herpes, the virus behind

genital warts is in perpetual stand-by mode. And, as long

as we were on the subject, she had herpes, too, though

she hadn't had an outbreak for a few years. At least she

possessed the sense and courage to t\~ll me about everything from the start, rather than waiting un_til things

between us got "serious."

Of course these days, no matter how much latex

shielding is employed, all sexual sports are serious business, requiring a high tolerance for danger. In terms

of physical risk, we've gone from golf to ice hockey.

I avoided entering this rink longer than most. I wasn't

afraid of diseases so much as the women themselves. I

just couldn't tell a girl I found her attractive-it felt as

though doing so would be an imposition on her otherwise trouble-free life. The few sexual relationships that

did manage to penetrate my shield of insecurity followed

weeks or even months of what could loosely be called

co\~rtship. I was never sure if I was truly old fashioned,

or JUSt afraid to dive into physical intimacy and its atten-

dant embarrassments. Maybe that's why I started writing about love rather than experiencing it first hand.

Sublimating my sexuality into rny writing wasn't without Jong-tenn benefits. During a spate of book tours a

couple of years ago, I discovered that a good reading

at Borders can translate into romance at the Hilton ("I

think we can still get room service at this hour") , thus

reducing my usually extended courtship phase to a few

hours, at best. This has led to a corresponding reduction

in my ability to do any intelligence gathering about what

viral companions I. might be bringing home with me at

tour's end.

The youngest women I've been with don't generally

lie about their conditions. They simply don't know about

them at all, nor do they want to. "I've never been tested

for anything," a grad student informed me as s_he

removed her clothes. "I'm scared of what would show

up." I guess that counts as an open-ended disclosure.

The one older woman I dated, however--a marriedbut-pretty-m uch-separated audiologist-withheld the

truth until long after I would consider it appropriate.

I (incorrectly) assumed that because she had been married for so long, and since I was her first affair, she was

"clean." It turns out she was so afraid to tell me about

her recurrent herpes condition that she lied and said her

sores were the result of an allergy to latex condoms.

When she finally fessed up, I felt violated. "See?" she said,

"I knew you'd react this way. That's why I didn't tell you."

It wasn't the herpes that bothered me as much as her

dishonesty. Not to mention the fortune I spent on less2sexE 141

safe lambskin condoms, under the painful impression

I had made her physically ill with latex.

I guess she came from the other end of the disclosure spectrum-those who tell lovers about their communicable diseases if and only if the relationship has

moved beyond casual (and inherently risky) sex into

something more committed. Theoretically, this strategy

favors the STD-afflicted, because it gives them more time

to establish bonds before dropping the relationshipthreatening news.

But, with me anyway, it tends to work in reverse. If

a woman tells me of a potential transmission before we've

had any sex, I'll tend to overcompensate in her favor and .

do my best to show that I'm still helplessly attracted to

her. 'When she doesn't tell me until afterwards, though,

I am given a brand new excuse to retreat. If, subconsciously, I really am afraid of contracting whatever it is

she's got, now I can use her dishonesty as my rationale

to break it off in righteous indignation.

Thanks to good fortune alone, I am still disease-free,

and would prefer to stay that way, at least until I'm married. Don't get me wrong: I'm no_t afraid of the herpes

themselves, whatever they are, or any other disease whose

symptoms don't include death. I'd be all-too-willing to

risk catching herpes from my lover, but only if I knew

she was going to be my last and lifelong partner. That's

because I'm most afraid of being a carrier-of having

to talk about it, or, even worse, of giving a disease to

someone else. (I'd rather be the person waiting in the

rain than the one who's late for the rendezvous, too.)

Now that my wilder days have passed-and they only

night for the lowdown. Hepatitis C, in her case the result

than AIDS, and potentially just as fatal. After SLX to eight

years of dormancy, it can attack the liver like a cancer.

Worse, the virus is found in all the best juices, including saliva and other nectars-not just blood and semen.

funerals-didn't exactly turn me on to the idea of sex

with this woman. But neither did it free me from a deep

sense of guilt. Why should a person who obviously has

her shit together now be forced to pay for mistakes of

the past? I'd done different but equally stupid things

myself when I was nineteen, and only luck saved me from

my recklessness. Besides, I could only respect her for

managing to work this particularly touchy subject into

a conversation on our first date. That is, if she really

felt like it was a touchy subject at all.

I was afraid to find out. Instead, I went ahead and

foolishly shared my fears with the friend who had introduced us in the first place. It turns out he had had a brief

fling with her years before and now he was scared, too.

That very night, he ·picked up the phone. and expressed

his concern, using my concern as a cover. He eventually confessed his leak to me, along with the woman's

response: What's the big deal? Everyone who used IV

drugs has it, and only ten percent of them get the fullblown disease.

That kind of pissed me off. I'm not a weird sissy for

being a bit freaked out by the chance of contracting a

potentially fatal disease, am I? But what right did I have

to be pissed off? I never had the courage to tell her

how I felt.

• I've been out with her a few times since, and feel

like a shit not only for avoiding sexual situations ( even

though I usually wouldn't be having sex this early, anyway), but also for avoiding talking about the subject. 1

know she knows, but I just can't bring the subtext to

the surface.

I've . rationalized that she . probabl Y 1sn . , t tru 1 y inter- .

ested , 1n me at all-she's so cool , and 1, m sue h a geek.

She d surely figure this out sooner or later and drop me,

anyway. \\1/hy risk getting a fatal disease just to be heartbroken, too? I mean, if we were already in love and found

out together that she had a potentially fatal disease, it

would be our problem. At the outset, though, with

chances being so slim of actually forging a lasting relationship together, why risk death?

Besides, if I were to straight-out tell her how I felt

about STDs, hepatitis and dental dams, it would be a

bit presumptuous, no? How do I know she's even interested in having sex with me at all?

But that's crap and I know it. If Hep-C is a dealbreaker for me, I should just admit it. But, like many

of us who have tumed to the pen, I find I can be more

honest in public print than in person. Thus this little

essay: a confession of sorts-and a plea for understanding.
