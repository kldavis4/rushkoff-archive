**Reason for despair:** We are blindly running an extractive, growth-driven economic operating system that has reached the limits of its ability to serve anyone, rich or poor, human or corporate. Moreover, we’re running it on digital networks that amplify all its effects. Growth is the single, uncontested, core command of the economy, and when accelerated through supercomputers, threatens human existence. Meanwhile, by refusing to acknowledge the existence of this man-made landscape and our complicity in perpetuating it, we render ourselves incapable of getting beneath its surface. We end up optimizing our technologies for an existentially threatening economic model, instead of for the sustainability of humanity. I am saddened by clueless tech billionaires, who can't see how their technologies and companies are draining the real economy of the means to create and transact value.

**Reason for hope:** Instead of simply digitizing industrial extraction in the name of growing more capital, our new media technologies can distribute value creation in the name of a sustainable economy. I find hope in the emergence of “platform cooperatives”—alternatives to the platform monopolies of Uber and Amazon—where the people working through a platform share in its ownership. I see the hands-on ethos of the digital era inspiring people to see corporate code as entirely fungible, and the venerated IPO as a pyramid scheme to be eschewed rather than the goal of a sustainable business. At my most hopeful, I see the extreme divisions of wealth we’re enduring today as less a permanent state than the sort of mitosis a cell undergoes just before it reproduces: perhaps we are in the midst of a renaissance through which we will recover peer-to-peer value exchange, locally-scaled enterprise, and human-centric economic values.
