TV isn't just for the masses. Sure, there are those huge, national spectacle moments that stay in our individual and cultural memory as if they were implanted surgically: O.J. Simpson pretending that he couldn't fit into his gloves. Tonya Harding whining about her improperly tied figure skates. Rhoda taking the subway to her own wedding. Nixon resigning. Radar O'Reilly saluting through tears on the last episode of _M*A_*_S*H_. Seinfeld and company in their prison cell. These moments bring us all together because we've all seen them-and we know that so many others watched them at the very same time.

But there's another, even more profound way for television to nest itself into our consciousness. It can make any one of us believe we are the only person in the world who really gets what it is going on. It was during those lonely moments when it was just me and the tube against an otherwise nonsensical world that my real relationship with this very personal medium was forged.

It happened to a lot of us who worked as baby-sitters in the

early 1970s, when we got that first glimpse of a bizarre British phenomenon called Monty Python's Flying Cireus on PBS, late at night (even after Don Kirschner's Rock Concert). For a bleary-eyed fourteen-year-old sitting in some suburban couple's idea of the fully realized American dream den, "Spam, eggs, sausage, and Spam" seemed like a personal message an acknowledgment that life's menu wasn't offering any real alternatives. It was all Spam.

A few years later, those of us who responded so intensely to Monty Python had found one another, and learned we were part of what is called a "cult following." We all bought Monty Python records and tickets for their New York appearances, and helped turn them into a national phenomenon.

The more obscure the media reference, the more profound the bond between those of us who shared it. Although it's always tremendously gratifying to find someone else who remembers some phantom television event from my past, it's also oddly disappointing. It feels as if the acknowledgment somehow confirms what may have been a television fantasy into a fact. No-I wasn't dreaming that television moment. It really happened, and other people experienced it, too. The same way I did.

Maybe that's why college, for me, was mainly an opportunity to compare and contrast television moments with people from other parts of the country. I remember there was one particular show I really wanted to know if anyone else had experienced: a short black-and-white film called The Cube.

The movie aired as part of a Sunday-morning Christian drama series in the late 1960s. In it, a man discovers himself trapped in a small, room-sized cube. The walls are white squares. He is visited by several people, including a small child on a tricycle who taunts him. When he punches his fist through the wall, a repairman enters with a new piece of wall that fits in the jagged hole perfectly
