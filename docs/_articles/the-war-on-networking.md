The attack on the World Trade Tower is no more an attack on the global economy than it is an attack on the global network. That's right: the Internet we've argued over for the past ten years has been targeted. Given the quality of a lot of what I've read online since the attack, it's hard to be too upset. The Internet is at war with itself, when it should be coming to terms with its real enemies.

I've watched as people on politically progressive mailing lists--from Nettime to my own media-squat--have wrestled with the introduction of such a glaring discontinuity into their conceptual narratives. Everyone is attempting to "make sense" of the World Trade Center tragedy. Unfortunately, as in any moment when things don't make any real sense, many people are reaching for conspiracy theories, or retreating into one brand of blind fundamentalism or another. Let's entertain them for a moment.

The Internet conspiracies range from a secret Bush-Bin Laden oil deal to a joint effort by Israel and America to earn support for the war against the Palestinians. These ideas all stem from a sense of responsibility for what happened. Of course. People who have experienced networking know that no single force is responsible for such a catastrophe.

But we don't need an outlandish theory to see that we have been engaged in a certain kind of war for a long time, and that the rules of that war are changing. Throughout the cold war, we had an agreement with USSR to stay within certain parameters of engagement. We maintained nuclear arsenals, generally stayed away from one another's hemispheres, and supported insurgents with money.

Our tactics during this period included training and arming people like Bin Laden. We also supported countries with resources or forms of government we liked. (If we do care to look beneath the surface, our support of Jordan's intentionally repressive monarchy is much more objectionable than our support of Israel's attempted democracy. Alas, the Palestinians don't have any idea how hated they are by the so-called Arab community.) The concrete karmic result of US policy is that the monsters we create eventually tum on us.

And all of this is being fairly well reported by mainstream American media channels like the New York Times and network news. (If Fox news is focusing on patriotism and Olympic-games-like heartwarming narratives, so be it. That's what old-style right-wing media is for.)

A few embassy bombings were not enough to

show us what we had created. The World

Trade Center was. We have made terrible mis-

takes in our ongoing war effort. And the very

people that the USSR and the USA were once

fighting over are now fighting against us.

But whatever role we historically played, and

however ineffectual our strategy, what we

have been aiming to support over the past

couple of centuries is creativity and free will.
