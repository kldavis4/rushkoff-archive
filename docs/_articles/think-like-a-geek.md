What distinguishes you from your competition? Your brand? Your customer database? Your distribution? Your product? I beg to differ. In the long run, the only thing that distinguishes your business from anyone else's is your smarts.

By "smarts" I don't just mean your personal intelligence, or even the intelligence of the people working for you, but the intelligence with which your entire culture operates. What smarts does your company bring to the table? Or to put it another way, how does the very existence of your firm change the rules of the game?

I believe we're in the midst of a unique window of opportunity--fostered by the low standards and bottom line obsessions of today's global industries. There's a conspiracy of incompetence out there in the greater market place. Companies are searching desperately for ways to "outsource" their core competencies to anyone who will pick up the slack and maybe deliver goods for a few cents cheaper than can be accomplished at home.

And, as most firms eventually learn, such wanton disregard for core competencies may look good on the first quarterly report or two, but ultimately costs more when a disaster strikes (think Chinese toys) or customers figure out that their favourite products are made under unfavourable conditions (the famous "Nike effect", named after the sport shoe company's bad publicity following allegations of sweatshop exploitation). Sure, a CEO might be able to vest some quick options by dumbing down a company through lay-offs or outsourcing, but then what's left of the company itself? A balance sheet?

Shareholders looking for a fast sale may be happy with such short-term solutions, but no one who works for you or buys from you will be. And if you have any love for your industry, or any passion at all for what it is your company supposedly does, neither will you.

**No, the secret of success in today's global and highly commodified market place is to zig when they're all zagging. While most companies look for "out of the box" solutions that distance them from their core competencies, the smart company strives to get back in the box and become the ultimate geeks of their industry.

Such a strategy initiates a virtuous circle between management,
