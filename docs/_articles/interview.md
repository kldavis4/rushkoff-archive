**Douglas Rushkoff has written on subjects ranging from religion to technology. He's been a best selling author for many years, but it's only recently that he's entered into the comic book world. His Vertigo book. Testament, examines a near future in which a band of renegades have teamed up to combat threats to freedom.** 

**(excerpted - full interview at SuicideGirls.com)** 

Daniel Robert Epstein: Testament is a very complex book even for Vertigo standards. I bet Vertigo came to you rather than you going to them to do a book. 

them doing the Bible in this complex way with Go both and we'll see what happens." Karen Berger, the fan of this weird Jewish book I wrote a couple years where I wrote that if Christianity is about the good n the bad news. Christianity tends to be, "Don't worry, t all saved, all we have to do is this.” Judaism says. Humans are in charge of this realm. If there is a God. I care of yourselves." She liked that and she had a kid vahed so she was on that wavelength that there's Vi it's been completely corrupted and re-contextualizer 

DRE: Which is more important in Testament, the ic characters themselves? 

Douglas Rushkoff: Totally. But I wanted to do a comic for a while, since 1994, wrote a book called Playing the Future, which is now called Screenagers. It was a look at the emerging, non-linear, lateral thinking, chaotic culture that we were in before the web existed. What I was doing was looking at the things out there that thought represented the future of our culture. It was everything that was unknown in the States at the time from Gundam Robots to anime, to Hong Kong cinema, snowboarding, videogames and most of all, comics. I saw comics as non-linear. Not just as we moved into a visual culture, but as we moved into a society that understood there were more subtle connections between different things. We had a generation of kids growing up who could enjoy the roughness, the gaps in reality, rather than needing everything so curvilinear, geometric, Euclidean and perfect. There was both a lower culture and a scientific culture that was saying, “No, it's in the errors. It's in the roughness, it's in the chaos that we're going to find the patterns and the solutions." So I wrote this book that talked about the chaos mass, self-similarity and fractals and all that, and on the other hand talked about snowboarders and skateboarders looking for rough patches and going on curves and understanding the urban terrain as do-it-yourself thing that can be hacked. Then I read Scott McCloud's book Understanding Comics, where he was basically saying that comics have abilities to do all these things and it's important for people making comics to get that these aren't just books with pictures. This is a different medium that can work in different ways. 

DR: They're one and the same. That's like asking,' portant, Abraham or God?” The Bible and my book ship between human beings and the dynamics unde Fortunately and unfortunately, they're of equal imp order to engage a human being in my story, I got about moving through situations that matter. The 1 is that the situations that they're in aren't just their we're doing everything we do by free will and ou scious choices, we're hopelessly trapped in a na other words, we've written a story that we refuse budge from that story, it's going to get really bad, dent who doesn't care about the environment bec over pretty soon anyway. 

The story itself is a character in a way that I don't going to overtake the characters. It's more that consciously fighting against the plot and the ide tions. In a way, those ideas are characters. That's 

DRE: I found a Christian website that said Testa than the comic book, Preacher. 

"Humans are in charge of this realm.” 

Since then I've always wanted to get involved in it. Then I became friends with Grant Morrison, who sees comics as magical sigils. He comes from the Aleister Crowley tradition of comics. Grant excited me about the idea that you could bring weird, literary ideas to comics and that there was some commercial opening for that. Then I shot a flare up into the sky with this weird little comic strip called Club Zero G that I did in this magazine called BPM. I got interviewed about that and when I was interviewed they asked, "Why'd you do this?" I said, "I did this so maybe someone at Vertigo or Marvel would call me and ask me to do a comic." Then, this guy from Vertigo, Jonathan Vankin, called and said, “Do you want to do a comic?" I said, "Sure!" He said, “What do you want to do?" I said, “Well, I got two ideas. One is to do this weird ass Bible thing and the other is something based off \[Andrei\] Tarkovsky's movie, Stalker, about some weird guy who walks people through these bizarre, psychedelic realms and gets their possessed ba bies back. He said, "That second one is way more likely to happen. I can't imagine
