It was Christmas Eve when award-winning author and documentarian Douglas Rushkoff was mugged in front of his "hip" Park Slope neighborhood apartment in Brooklyn while taking out his trash. He immediately did what any responsible neighbor would do: Warn his fellow residents as to the location and description of the assailant through the neighborhood's email list.

Instead of sympathy and thanks, what he received were angry emails chastising him for broadcasting information that "could adversely affect all our property values." Shocked from both the experience and his neighbors' reactions, Rushkoff's evolved his philosophy and he began to question his own complicity as a resident within a neighborhood more interested in buildings than the people who inhabit them. His investigation into how "corporate metrics" have replaced fundamental human values was recently published in the best seller, **Life, Inc. How the World Became a Corporation and How To Take It Back.**

Douglas Rushkoff is a visionary thinker and elegant communicator, able to distill and successfully articulate concepts without polarization or alienation. SuperConsciousness Magazine was pleased to speak with Mr. Rushkoff about the pervasiveness of corporatism, how the corporate mindset interferes with our natural tendencies towards altruistic behavior, and what we can do to rebuild our neighborhoods.
