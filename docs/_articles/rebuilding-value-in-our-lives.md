It was Christmas Eve when award-winning author and documentarian Douglas Rushkoff was mugged in front of his "hip" Park Slope neighborhood apartment in Brooklyn while taking out his trash. He immediately did what any responsible neighbor would do: Warn his fellow residents as to the location and description of the assailant through the neighborhood's email list.

Instead of sympathy and thanks, what he received were angry emails chastising him for broadcasting information that "could adversely affect all our property values." Shocked from both the experience and his neighbors' reactions, Rushkoff's evolved his philosophy and he began to question his own complicity as a resident within a neighborhood more interested in buildings than the people who inhabit them. His investigation into how "corporate metrics" have replaced fundamental human values was recently published in the best seller, **Life, Inc. How the World Became a Corporation and How To Take It Back.**

Douglas Rushkoff is a visionary thinker and elegant communicator, able to distill and successfully articulate concepts without polarization or alienation. SuperConsciousness Magazine was pleased to speak with Mr. Rushkoff about the pervasiveness of corporatism, how the corporate mindset interferes with our natural tendencies towards altruistic behavior, and what we can do to rebuild our neighborhoods.

**SC**: How did your conceptualization of your book, Life, Inc., change after the Park Slope mugging?

**DR**: Before the mugging I had a more abstract relationship to the material. As a media theorist, I understood that people were mistaking the medium of money for something real and that they didn't realize that this was just one kind of money created at a particular moment in history. To most people, money was just money, so I intended to write a book that explored the medium of our money - its biases and original intentions - through the lens of a media theorist.

I had already embarked on that process,

writing a book proposal and sending it out

to various editors to obtain an advance.

The economy hadn't crashed yet, but my

views had already become increasingly

anti-corporate or anti-market, in a real

but abstract sense. And then I got mugged

in front of my apartment.

The angry emails from people in

the neighborhood were bizarre to

me, because I realized instead of

people wanting to actually make their

neighborhood better, they wanted to

protect the "brand " of Park Slope, at the

expense of real people. Other neighbors

were getting mugged too and I found

that this was really common and that

the cops saw it as a big problem .

And even though a lot of it has to do

with gentrification and really awful

race relations , the minute you bring

up the reality that there·s awful race

relations, you get accused of being

some kind of a racist : ··what are you

saying? That it's black people that

mug and white people don"t?"'

What was really going on was that

a huge population of residents was

way over their heads in debt. They

needed the real estate prices in their

neighborhood to go up, not because

they want to sell, but because they
