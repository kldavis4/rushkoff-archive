It was Christmas Eve when award-winning author and documentarian Douglas Rushkoff was mugged in front of his "hip" Park Slope neighborhood apartment in Brooklyn while taking out his trash. He immediately did what any responsible neighbor would do: Warn his fellow residents as to the location and description of the assailant through the neighborhood's email list.

Instead of sympathy and thanks, what he received were angry emails chastising him for broadcasting information that "could adversely affect all our property values." Shocked from both the experience and his neighbors' reactions, Rushkoff's evolved his philosophy and he began to question his own complicity as a resident within a neighborhood more interested in buildings than the people who inhabit them. His investigation into how "corporate metrics" have replaced fundamental human values was recently published in the best seller, **Life, Inc. How the World Became a Corporation and How To Take It Back.**

Douglas Rushkoff is a visionary thinker and elegant communicator, able to distill and successfully articulate concepts without polarization or alienation. SuperConsciousness Magazine was pleased to speak with Mr. Rushkoff about the pervasiveness of corporatism, how the corporate mindset interferes with our natural tendencies towards altruistic behavior, and what we can do to rebuild our neighborhoods.

**SC**: How did your conceptualization of your book, Life, Inc., change after the Park Slope mugging?

**DR**: Before the mugging I had a more abstract relationship to the material. As a media theorist, I understood that people were mistaking the medium of money for something real and that they didn't realize that this was just one kind of money created at a particular moment in history. To most people, money was just money, so I intended to write a book that explored the medium of our money - its biases and original intentions - through the lens of a media theorist.

I had already embarked on that process, writing a book proposal and sending it out to various editors to obtain an advance. The economy hadn't crashed yet, but my views had already become increasingly anti-corporate or anti-market, in a real but abstract sense. And then I got mugged in front of my apartment.

The angry emails from people in the neighborhood were bizarre to me, because I realized instead of people wanting to actually make their neighborhood better, they wanted to protect the "brand" of Park Slope, at the expense of real people. Other neighbors were getting mugged too and I found that this was really common and that the cops saw it as a big problem. And even though a lot of it has to do with gentrification and really awful race relations, the minute you bring up the reality that there's awful race relations, you get accused of being some kind of a racist: "What are you saying? That it's black people that mug and white people don't?"

What was really going on was that a huge population of residents was way over their heads in debt. They needed the real estate prices in their neighborhood to go up, not because they want to sell, but because they need to refinance their debt at a better rate, and the only way to do that is if the total property is worth more. People were behaving like corporations!

**SC**: What kind of impact does that thinking have on a neighborhood?

**DR**: People's homes become valued as a real estate asset rather than as part of a community and the neighbors are no longer human beings. If they're neighbors and you are going to call them friends, it's because you want them to be wealthy so that your neighborhood is wealthy. You want your neighbor to keep his job so that he keeps his house up, so that your house is valuable, and this is seen as some kind of enlightened self-interest, when it is a completely dehumanized way of looking at the world.

I would argue that starts with debt. When you're indebted, you are enslaved to a certain kind of mentality. That's what the whole \[Old Testament\] Bible is about. For instance, in the story of Exodus, Joseph taught the Pharaoh how to indebt people, which turned them into slaves. They eventually got away and the first thing they did was to write a series of laws: Every seven days, you get to rest. Every seven years all debts are forgiven. That was created to prevent this kind of situation from occurring again.

**SC**: How does the mentality of indebtedness interfere with our natural tendencies towards altruism?

**DR**: In my grandparents' generation, when you made it good, you would get the wing of a hospital named after you. When I was growing up, that was the height of having "made it." It's very real and very local - like Macy's throwing the parade for the town that keeps them in business. So, you build a hospital wing and you want your name on it, you want credit, because you·re a human being, and who cares? I mean, serve the ego if the ego is going to serve humanity. l've got no problem with that.

But today, we relate to one another through products and brands and consumer choices and people exercise their altruism through these abstract entities. You join Greenpeace or Sierra Club, or this thing or that thing, but it's very hard for people to re-engage with an on-the-ground reality by joining these organizations that have had to adapt a style of traditional corporate branding in order to compete for your attention.

Once these organizations enter that

abstract realm, ifs really almost

impossible for people to distinguish

SC: You suggest that altruism begins

by getting involved locally?

between the big, top-down communication DR: What l"m talking about is kind of

behavior of a nonprofit and the big, a fractal activism. If the core problem

top-down communication of any other

for-profit corporation or even a nonprofit

thafs working against their very causes.

Ifs so hard to judge, and people feel

overwhelmed by the information and the

communication: Who·s real, who"s not

real? People end up becoming cynical and

just withdrawing. Ifs very hard to parse

information from the disinformation.
