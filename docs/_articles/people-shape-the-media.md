Most social theorists consider the media a dungheap of cultural waste. They believe that the media, having nothing better to do, keeps chewing on the same predigested matter. There's so much time to fill on so many stations, and only a few real stories to tell. This is a simplistic view of media only shared by philosophers who grew up before television. They view media and even technology, for that matter, as somehow outside the realm of the natural. To them media can only display or comment on something real. They cannot acknowledge that the media is something real itself.... This generation even objects to the word "media" being used as a singular noun. The media, to these people, are merely the channels through which we communicate: TV, print, bumper stickers, telegraph.

But those who grew up after the datasphere.¹ had been put in place see the media as something real, which must be reckoned with on its own terms. It can even be seen as an extension of the human, or even the planetary spirit.

1\. Rushkoff uses this term to express his idea that media have turned from a means by which institutions communicate to listeners and viewers into one where information can circulate freely from many sources.

The mediaspace, or "datasphere," is the new territory for human interaction. It has become our electronic social hall; issues that were formerly reserved for hushed conversations on walks home from church choir practice are now debated openly on afternoon talk shows, in front of live audiences composed of people "just like us." Good old-fashioned local gossip has been replaced by nationwide coverage of particularly resonant sex scandals. The mediaspace has also developed into our electronic town meeting (to use Ross Perot's expression). Traditional political debate and decisions have been absorbed by the ever-expanding forums of call-in radio and late-night variety shows. Today's most media-savvy politicians announce their candidacies on Larry King, and explain their positions on Rush Limbaugh or, better yet, primetime “infomercials."²

It has become fashionable to bemoan the fact that Dana Carvey's latest impersonation of a political celebrity means as much to the American voter as the candidate's official platform, or that kids today who may never have watched an evening news broadcast instead get passionate about the styles and attitudes depicted in the latest MTV video. We worry that our media industry has developed a generation of couch potatoes who are incapable of making an intelligent decision, too passive to act on one if they did.

That is not what is going on.

Nielsen “peoplemeters”³ may indicate which channels we're watching, but they tell little about our relationship to the media as a whole. Just because a family is “tuned in" doesn't mean it hasn't turned on and dropped out, too. No, the media web has neither captured nor paralyzed the American individual. It has provided her with the ability to chart and control the course of her culture. We've been empowered, folks.

Getting with the program means realizing that no one takes the mainstream media any more seriously than you do. Having been raised on a diet of media manipulation, we are all perfectly aware of the ingredients that go into these machinations. Children raised hearing and speaking a language always understand it better than adults who attempt to learn its rules. This is why our kids understand computers and their programming languages better than the men who designed them. Likewise, people weaned on media understand its set of symbols better than its creators. And now Americans feel free to talk back with their mouths, their remote controls, their joysticks, their telephones and even their dollars. Television has become an interactive experience.

The American mediascape. It is more than a mirror of our culture; it is our culture. It is where we spend our time, our money and our thought. But as we examine the nature of the datasphere more closely, we find it is a self referential cut-and-paste of itself. Most of media is media commenting on media commenting on media. Even if one real event just happens to occur—a black man gets beaten by white cops, or a girl shoots the wife of a man she loves—it soon becomes part of the overall self-reflexive pastiche of media.

Something is going on in media all its own that reflects less on the par ticular events being reported than it does on the nature of our cultural pre occupations and the ways in which we process them, Media is saving some thing in the way it churns its stories out, redigests them, and spits them out again. This is both a complex picture of the way our world works, and, at the same time, the actual process of cultural catharsis and modification....

Ironic Space

If nothing else, irony provides distance. With emotional distance from the material, the audience gains protection from the techniques of mind control. ...

But big business created something even bigger than itself: the datasphere. The media as a "thing" was developed to appeal to and direct human hunger. Its purpose was to whet viewers' appetites for new products. The world be hind the TV screen became a fantasy showroom of cars, appliances, lifestyles and attitudes which fueled the consumerist bonfire. The establishment of this national media universe worked better than the marketers expected. By the 60s, the media had become a world of its own. Kids could grow up spend ing more time in the media world than the real world. The datasphere be came our new natural environment. We projected onto it, or into it, a great intrinsic value. We compared our own lives to that of Marcia Brady-... . Tele vision characters filled our discussions, our fantasies, even our dreams. Who we were friends with depended on which shows we watched. Our cultural ter erences had more to do with what cartoons we admired than which sport we played or which church we belonged to. We treated the mediaspace as 11. were a real place, and it rose to the occasion.

The datasphere itself began to behave like a living organism. I biological being, it sought to grow. With the help of dollars from those still thought they were hardwiring consumer culture, the media expas into the tremendous worldwide web we enjoy today.

It was in catering to the kids' market that the engineers of consumer culture inadvertently empowered the masses they were attempting to ma nipulate. The marketers sought only to sell products, and adopted the phi losophy of “I give the kids what they want.” By creating a kids' market, they created a kids' culture, with its own needs and demands. They created what we now call “Generation X."S

This group of kids born since 1960 have taken their name from a ... novel about kids whose lives did not quite live up to the promises of the Brady Bunch or even the Partridge Family. While they've been called many things—stupid, apathetic, shallow, greedy, angry—their most important quality for our discussion is a sense of irony and irreverence. As we have seen, the irony was developed through an emotional distance from the sub jects of media. The irreverence for the sanctity of popular cultural ideol ogy came from this generation's ability to change what was on the screen. They don't just receive and digest media. They manipulate it. They play with it. ...

The ... chief critique of Generation X is that they are not creative. Their conversations—in real life and on the computer networks—as well as their own TV shows usually focus on media itself. Rather than coming up With original scenarios or new material, they may instead consider and re consider the ethical choices made in an episode of The Jetsons or Pee Wee's Playhouse, as if it is advanced cultural theory. What characterizes the GenX aesthetic and its conceptual preoccupation is a regeneration of imagery al ready in the media. ...

Media Virus

A black man is beaten by white cops in Los Angeles. The event is captured on a home camcorder and within hours the beating is replayed on the tele visions of millions. Within days it's the topic of an afternoon talk show; within weeks it's a court case on the fictional LA Law; within months it's a TV movie; before the end of the year it's the basis of a new video game, a comic book and set of trading cards. Finally, what began as a thirty-second video clip emerges as the battle cry for full-scale urban rioting. This riot, in turn, is amplified on more talk shows, radio call-ins and new episodes of LA Law! A provocative image or idea—like Rodney King getting beaten or even Pee Wee Herman beating off in a porno theater-spreads like wildfire. The event attracts our attention and generates media for several seconds, min utes, or even months—but its influence on us doesn't stop there.

Within every media sensation are ideas, issues and agendas which ence us less directly. A home video of police beating a black man, for ex ple, initiates a series of responses in the viewer. Questions of racism, poika brutality, the First Amendment, Los Angeles politics, drug abuse, ever power of consumergrade electronics—to name a few—are all releases single media image in its media context.

Media viruses spread rapidly if they provoke our interest, and their suc cess is dependent on the particular strengths and weaknesses of the host or ganism, popular culture. The more provocative an image or icon, like the videotaped police beating or a new rap lyric, the farther and faster it will travel through the datasphere. ...

A media virus may be designed to fight a political party, a religion, an institution, an economy, a business or even a system of thought. Just as sci entists use viruses to combat certain diseases within the human body or even to tag dangerous cells for destruction by the person's own antibodies, media activists use viruses to combat what they see as the enemies of our culture.

Viruses combat oversimplification and distraction. “Just say no" is a public relations effort to simplify and distract us from the real issues in volved in drug use. The phrase is designed to ignore the complex reality of life in the ghetto, peer pressure, the legality of certain drugs and the possi ble benefits of others. Similarly, the war on drugs appeals to the emotions, and couches other issues—racism, fear and class issues—in a blanket state ment against an enemy we can agree on. The issue here is not whether or not drug use should be sanctioned, but rather the specific tactics used by the manufacturers of consent to dominate public opinion.

The countercultural groups involved in the drug issue create viruses which explode these simple slogans. The viruses provoke more questions, Hot pat answers. The smart drugs virus, for one, is a seemingly oxymoronic phrase which makes us go "huh?" We do not raise our fists in anger against anamned enemy, but instead are forced to make sense, or at least try. Viruses open up iss

really is. The technique of oversimplification and distraction is rendered solete by the media virus.

Media viruses also disable the technique of marginalization. The first sponse of public relations to a countercultural idea is to marginalize it is you are against the war, then you are against our troops. If you are promot. ing gay rights, then you are against family values or even pro-AIDS and pro pederasty.... What allows media viruses to spread often appears to have little to do with the dangerous ideas within them. Even better, public rela tions forces often attempt to marginalize the shell of a virus before they un derstand its inner nature. Their attempts at marginalization only allow the virus to spread further. Ice T's fiery “Cop Killer" lyrics, for example, became famous only because of efforts to extinguish them. The media virus defied sidelining because the "censorship of rock” issue had legs of its own. ...

Usually what allows a virus to multiply ... is its ability to comment on the media itself. The shell of a virus can even be considered its “media iden tity.” The Murphy Brown/Dan Quayle charade gained momentum because it commented on the relationship between real and fictional newsmedia. The issues within it-single parenthood, the cultural elite—were secondary reasons. ... The viral shell ... takes advantage of our current media's ten dency to replicate anything which mirrors its own functioning and cut off yet another public relations tactic at the knees.

Self-Similarity

Viruses prevent the manufacturers of consent from exploiting “representa tion as reality." Viruses couch themselves in irony, and appeal to the ironic sensibilities of their viewers...

Countercultural media generally ... works in complementary ways on many levels at once. The MTV video for Jesus Jones' Right Here Right Now is about how our culture is experiencing a moment where it may have an op portunity to break from its historical cycles. "Right here right now." the lyrics say “there is no place I'd rather be. Right here right now, Watching the world wake up from history." Behind the band as they perform is a movie screen of rapidly cut news imagery: scenes like the destruction of the Berlin Wall or the fall of communism. The video is a rapidly edited series of discontinuous cuts, disrespectful of the linear, orderly rules of traditional. narrative filmmaking. It appears on MTV, which plays video after video. linked together only by disorienting, discontinuous graphics. Finally, the MTV network is only one of the many channels available now through cable television, which the viewer flips through with his remote watching CNN images on one channel, music images on another and both pasted to gether here. As if to recognize their own place in this giant self-similar lat ticework, the performers in the band allow the news footage to be directly onto their bodies. Jesus Jones sings about the discontinuous nature of modern social history, at the same time as its video, the station it is

Media Democracy

The last of the public relations ploys that viruses obliterate is the mainte

ance of a sidelined, spectator democracy. Participatory, feedback media prevents dissident individuals from feeling that they are alone. News shows which attempt to demonstrate that America supports a given war are under mined by alternative news coverage of protests and demonstrations. Any individual who watches network news can voice her discontent with the way a story has been presented by calling a talk radio show or posting an opinion on a computer bulletin board. The dissident opinion iterates onto every radio tuned to the same station or computer screen that accesses the same bulletin board. Fax transmission and pirate radio in cultures as repres sive as pre-revolutionary Romania permitted the masses of discontents to realize they were not alone. No. They may not have been allowed to assem ble in public legally, but their alternative media allowed them to network, organize, and find other people who felt equally marginalized by their lead ers. Meanwhile, here in the United States, these technologies have permit ted our citizenry to graduate from passive, ignorant spectators to active, in formed participants.

Participation can range from simply watching TV to designing global networks. What constitutes activity in the datasphere is only limited by the number of ways a person can be exposed to or iterate viruses. As the data Sphere grows, each of us come into contact with more of our viral culture. The media promotes a new kind of intimacy and no one with even a TV set can escape the flood.

For the media is like water. It conducts social electricity. Wherever it spreads its contents are carried, too. Social theorist Irwin Thompson, who is about 50, is most famous for his book The American Replacement of Nature, in which he warns that the development of the mediaspace may be an un natural thing. He even demonizes the people behind the expansion of the computer nets. At his Haight Street office the professor argued about whether or not we should be so optimistic about the growth of media. "Electronic communication is totally destroying literate civilization.

there's this whole sense of the planet as the public space. And this makes moral escape really hard."

And far from seeking escape, Americans want more.

You can ignore media viruses if you like, but it's already too late. If you've gotten this far, you've already been infected.

evidence would he bring to bear to dispute it? 2. Manheim says that "we need an intermediary ... We need the news
