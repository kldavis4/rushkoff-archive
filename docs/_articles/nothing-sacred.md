Can we talk? Why aren't I surprised that none other than Joan Rivers is responsible for one of the most accurate

condensations of the core values of a three

thousand year old tradition. It was the Jews'

struggle for self-preservation, afte r all, as well

as their deeply held humanist beliefs, that made

third century Romans purchased memberships in

J ewish synagogues just so they could t ake part in

besieged Israel. The iconoclasm intrinsic to the

descendants of Abraham-the legendary idol

smasher- bas been discarded, but the obsolete

racist and sexist beliefs of our ancestors-

some prayer books still include a prayer t hat
