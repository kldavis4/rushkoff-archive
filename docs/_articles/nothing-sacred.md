Can we talk? Why aren't I surprised that none other than Joan Rivers is responsible for one of the most accurate condensations of the core values of a three thousand year old tradition. It was the Jews' struggle for self-preservation, after all, as well as their deeply held humanist beliefs, that made them promoters of open discussion--so much that third century Romans purchased memberships in Jewish synagogues just so they could take part in intellectual conversations.

Sadly, for many Jews today, Judaism is a closed book. Jewish texts are not open for scrutiny; they are intentionally left closed. In many synagogues, community is either forgone or leveraged in the name of fundraising for a besieged Israel. The iconoclasm intrinsic to the descendants of Abraham--the legendary idol smasher--has been discarded, but the obsolete racist and sexist beliefs of our ancestors--some prayer books still include a prayer that thanks God for not making us women1--have been preserved.

The good news is that Judaism has faced such crises before and survived. In each instance, a small minority of the Jewish population adopted a radically recontextualized understanding of its fundamental tenets. And in each instance, only that small minority flourished, carrying into the next era what would from then on be called "Judaism." Each successful shift involved experiencing, or reexperiencing, Judaism's most essential insights of basic humanism and iconoclasm.

Unfortunately, the current landscape of Jewish offerings isn't pretty. Take the new age movement, which offers a wide variety of spiritual choices for those fed up with the institutional biases of religion. Kabbalah feels cool and controversial: not your father's Judaism. But its "secret" truths have nothing to do with the origins of Torah or the development of Jewish law. Devotees pay thousands of dollars for multivolume sets of the _Zohar_, an ancient mystical interpretation of Judaism that is written in ancient Aramaic. They don't read these books, but instead, pass their eyes over the cryptic text and absorb the energy within them. Seeking something spiritual while still getting to be Jewish, most get neither.

 T he rei nventio n of Judaism as "cool" is also the aim of philanthropies and outreach organizations that have taken it upon themselves to repackage a religion for a vast population of lapsed and disaffected J ews.
