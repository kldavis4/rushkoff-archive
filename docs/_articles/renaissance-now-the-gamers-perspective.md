The frightening news is that we are living in a story. The reassuring part is that it's a story we re writing, ourselves.

Alas, though, most of us don't even know it--or are afraid to accept it. Never before did we have so much access to the tools of storytelling--yet few of us are willing to participate in their creation. Gamers might be today's most likely candidates to helm what I hope will be a renaissance in our relationship to stories as well as the reality they mean to describe and influence.

We are living in a world of stories. We can't help but use narratives to understand the events that occur around us. The unpredictability of nature, emotions, social interactions and power relationships led human beings, from prehistoric times, to develop narratives that described the patterns underlying the movements of these forces. Although we like to believe that primitive people actually believed the myths they created about everything from the weather to the afterlife, a growing camp of religious historians are coming to the conclusion that early religions were understood much more metaphorically than we understand religion, today. They didn't believe that the wind or rain were gods; they invented characters whose personalities reflected the properties of these elements. The characters and their stories served more as ways of remembering that it would be cold for four months before spring returns, than genuinely accepted explanations. The people were quite self-consciously and actively anthropomorphizing the forces of nature.

As different people and groups competed for authority, they used their narratives quite

differently. They used their stories to gain advantage. Stories were no longer being used

\-simply to predict the patterns of nature, but to describe and influence the courses of -

politics, economics, and power. In such a world, stories compete solely on the basis of

their ability to win believers. To be understood as real. When the Pharaoh or King is

treated as tt he were a god, it means his subjects are still actively participating in the

sham. He still needs to prove his potency, in real ways, at regular intervals. But tt the

ruler can somehow get his followers to accept the story of his divine authority as

historical fact, then he need prove nothing. The story itseW serves as a substitute for

reality.

Since Biblical times, we have been living in a world where the stories we use to describe

and predict our reality have been presented as truth and mistaken for fact. These

narratives, and their tellers, compete for believers in two_ways: thro\~gh the content of

the stories, and through the medium or tools through which the stones are told. The.

content of a story might be considered the "what,• where the techn?logy th\~ugh \~1ch

the story is transmitted can be considered the "how.• A story can vie f\~r b\~hevers in \~oth

ways-through the narrative itseW, or by changing the level of the playing field on which

it is competing.

Exclusive access to the "how• of storytelling lets a storyteller monopolize t\~e •\~\~at.• In

ancient times, people were captivated by the epic storyteller as much for his ab1hty to
