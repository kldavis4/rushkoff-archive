Though I can't prove it more than anecdotally or experientially, I believe that evolution has purpose and direction. To me it seems obvious, if absolutely unconfirmable, that matter is groping toward complexity. True enough, stresses and threats, ranging from time and friction to decomposition and predators, require objects and life-forms to achieve some measure of durability in order to sustain themselves. But this ability to surviveseems to me more a means to an end than an end in itself.

Theo}ogy goes a long way toward imbuing substance and

processes with meaning - describing life as 'matter reaching

toward divinity,' or as the process by which divinity calls matter

back to itselÂ£ But theologians mistakenly ascribe this sense of

purpose to history rather than to the future. This is only natu-

ral, since the narrative structures we use to understand our

World tend to have beginnings, middles, and ends. In order t\~

experience the payoff at the end of the story, we need to see it

as somehow built into the original intention of events.

It's also hard for people to contend with the likely possibility

that we are simply overadvanc\~d fungi and bacte,ria hurtling

our existence may have ar1sen un1ntent1011ally and without pur-

pose doesn't preclude meaning or pur?ose from. emerging as a

result of our interaction and collaborat1on. Meaning may not be

a precondition for human\~ty as much as, a by-\~roduct .of it,

Ir>s important to recognize that cvolut1on at its best 1s a team

sport. As Darwin,s later, lesser known but more important

works contend, survival of the fittest is a law that applies not as

much to individuals as to groups. Likewise, most great leaps for-

ward in human civilization, from the formation of clans to the

building of cities, have been feats of collaborative effort.

Increased survival rates are as much a happy side effect of good

collaboration as its purpose.

If we could stop thinking of 'meaning' and 'purpose' as arti-

facts of some -divine creative act and see them instead as the

yield of our own creative future, they become goals, intentions,

and processes very much in reach rather than the shadows of

childlike, superstitious mythology. .

T\~e proof is i\~possible, since this is an unfolding story. Like

reaching the honzon, arrival merely necessitates more travel.
