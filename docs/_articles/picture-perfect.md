It was back around the fourth grade. Before any of us even knew what a homosexual was. Well, some of my classmates probably knew, but I didn't—which is part of what made me so vulnerable to the damning accusation.

I had just endured another one of those difficult mid-year moves from one public school district to another. It was a move up, as far as my parents were concerned, from the marginally upper-middle-class sections of Queens and then Larchmont to the indisputably upper-middle-class zip code of Scarsdale, where the school taxes rivaled the tuition at Andover. The relocation had just about tapped out my dad's income, so we stuck with clothes from Sears for those first couple of years while everyone else at school was already wearing those polos with the alligator on the tit, genuine Pumas or Adidas, and winter coats called "snorkels" with fake fur around the hood.

Me, well, my jeans had generic circles on the back pockets instead of Levi's trademarked double-hump glyph, and I wore PF Flyers that, where I came from, were a heartfelt statement of countercultural rebellion against the omnipresence of Keds. My shirts were of the button-down, reptile-free variety, and my sole winter coat was a Dacron-filled shell of shiny gold polymer. It had a stiff, box-shaped hood with a window-like opening for my face that prompted my first official Scarsdale nickname, "Spaceman."

Somehow, just as word began trickling down from junior high school about the incipient emergence of the first pubic sprouts, the universal taunt for the alien from Larchmont shifted from Spaceman to "faggot." And though I could run as fast and jump as high as almost anyone in the fourth, fifth, and eventually sixth grade, it never changed again.

I didn't really have any attraction to girls at this point—not that I had one for boys, either—so it was hard for me to disprove the underlying premise of the community-composed "Dougie's a Fem" theme song. Did everybody else know something about me that I didn't? Atter all, they couldn't have reached such a decisive and unanimous verdict by chance. By the time I turned eleven, I concluded on a fairly conscious level that the only way to fend off this onslaught of psychic terrorism was to prove I was a real boy, not a girlie boy, and certainly not a fem—whatever that meant. It was a life strategy that would prove to have diminishing returns.

I started my straight-boy self-education like most American males: with porn. I had no idea where my dad was hiding those _Playboys_ he got half-jokingly from his own dad on his 40th birthday, and actuaIly suspected my mom was making him dispose of them as soon as they arrived. My best hope was to cut her off at the pass and take one directly from the mailbox. This would be difficult, because my mom got to the mail first every day except Saturday. There was only a one out of six shot that the magazine would arrive on a Saturday, and even less that I'd be able to snag it without being noticed.

It was the morning that my brother was heading out with my parents for his second day of bar mitzvah portraits—I remember there had been some problem with the first batch—and I had been left alone. I'd have just a two-hour window for the mail to arrive, and it would _have_ to contain that month's _Playboy_. So I resorted to another mail-order item my father had purchased a few years before, a cheesy book on how to use witchcraft for power and happiness.

I retrieved the volume from a box in the attic. I found a bizarre spell in there for "wish fulfillment," which involved caressing the leaves of plants with your hands or preferably, your genitals while you concentrate on the object of desire. I considered focusing on a real woman—but a woman is not what I wanted. I wanted the next issue of _Playboy_ to be delivered within the hour. Thanks to the spell, I still believe, the magazine came before my parents and brother got back from the photographer.

But I didn't—or hadn't yet—associated pictures of female body parts with erotic excitement, and the magazine's many depictions of primary and secondary sexual anatomy weren't really helping. Sure, seeing breasts was interesting, but it wasn't really titillating, which is where I assumed that word came from. I felt a certain hot naughtiness—more of a flushness, really—whenever I'd pull the magazine from its secret hiding place and attempt masturbation. But I didn't fully understand how the pictures and my excitement were to be connected.

Somewhere between breasts and lens, photos and eyes, frontal lobe and hand, the erotic circuit between Miss July and my penis was not completed. It was far easier to masturbate alone in the bed, thinking about masturbation itself.

It was about a year later that I managed to find an image, or state of mind, that did the trick. I can still see it if I close my eyes: a short-cropped brunette, splayed against a bed of deep green leaves. She looked like a pixie or wood nymph from one of those medieval poems about

Judaism a year or so ago. For it was there that I met a woman who just       P•vcliosexual fundamentalists. Besides—I'd found someone I could ac-

   Barbara immediately struck me as a person I wanted to know                  Yes, I think I've found "the one," precisely because she's the one

not, and I'm plagued by the same old nagging objections from the 

remaining script development people in my head. But that's the price 

we must pay to live in the real world. Everyone should at least try it. 

You, too.

  What I've come to realize is that being a man means giving up the 

false security of defining my masculinity against an obsolete and crudely 

drawn notion of the feminine. Being a man has nothing to do with not 

being a woman, and everything to do with being a person who makes 

his own choices in real life. When you lose the screenplay you may also 

lose the approval of the crowd, but you'll be more than compensated 

with the joy of autonomy.

  It may be a little tougher to live life this way, but hell—someone's 

got to be a real man.                                       MY SISTER AND I ‘I—,
