It was back around the fourth grade. Before any of us even knew what a homosexual was. Well, some of my classmates probably knew, but I didn't—which is part of what made me so vulnerable to the damning accusation.

I had just endured another one of those difficult mid-year moves from one public school district to another. It was a move up, as far as my parents were concerned, from the marginally upper-middle-class sections of Queens and then Larchmont to the indisputably upper-middle-class zip code of Scarsdale, where the school taxes rivaled the tuition at Andover. The relocation had just about tapped out my dad's income, so we stuck with clothes from Sears for those first couple of years while everyone else at school was already wearing those polos with the alligator on the tit, genuine Pumas or Adidas, and winter coats called "snorkels" with fake fur around the hood.

Me, well, my jeans had generic circles on the back pockets instead of Levi's trademarked double-hump glyph, and I wore PF Flyers that, where I came from, were a heartfelt statement of countercultural rebellion against the omnipresence of Keds. My shirts were of the button-down, reptile-free variety, and my sole winter coat was a Dacron-filled shell of shiny gold polymer. It had a stiff, box-shaped hood with a window-like opening for my face that prompted my first official Scarsdale nickname, "Spaceman."

Somehow, just as word began trickling down from junior high school about the incipient emergence of the first pubic sprouts, the universal taunt for the alien from Larchmont shifted from Spaceman to "faggot." And though I could run as fast and jump as high as almost anyone in the fourth, fifth, and eventually sixth grade, it never changed again.

I didn't really have any attraction to girls at this point—not that I had one for boys, either—so it was hard for me to disprove the under-lying premise of the community-composed "Dougie's a Fem" theme song. Did everybody else know something about me that I didn't? Atter all, they couldn't have reached such a decisive and unanimous verdict by chance. By the time I turned eleven, I concluded on a fairly ►liscious level that the only way to fend off this onslaught of psychic terrorism was to prove I was a real boy, not a girlie boy, and certainly tiot a fern whatever that meant. It was a life strategy that would prove t) have diminishing returns. I started my straight-boy self-education like most American males: " th porn. I had no idea where my dad was hiding those Playboys I • got half-jokingly from his own dad on his 40th birthday, and actu-,Ily suspected my mom was making him dispose of them as soon as Hy arrived. My best hope was to cut her off at the pass and take one I cetly from the mailbox. This would be difficult, because my mom r,ot to the mail first every day except Saturday. There was only a one out or six shot that the magazine would arrive on a Saturday, and even Icy, that I'd be able to snag it without being noticed. It was the morning that my brother was heading out with my par-• Ht., tor his second day of bar mitzvah portraits—I remember there had 111Th t some problem with the first batch—and I had been left alone.
