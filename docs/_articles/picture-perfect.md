It was back around the fourth grade. Before any of us even knew what a homosexual was. Well, some of my classmates probably knew, but I didn't—which is part of what made me so vulnerable to the damning accusation.

I had just endured another one of those difficult mid-year moves from one public school district to another. It was a move up, as far as my parents were concerned, from the marginally upper-middle-class sections of Queens and then Larchmont to the indisputably upper-middle-class zip code of Scarsdale, where the school taxes rivaled the tuition at Andover. The relocation had just about tapped out my dad's income, so we stuck with clothes from Sears for those first couple of years while everyone else at school was already wearing those polos with the alligator on the tit, genuine Pumas or Adidas, and winter coats called "snorkels" with fake fur around the hood.

Me, well, my jeans had generic circles on the back pockets instead of Levi's trademarked double-hump glyph, and I wore PF Flyers that, where I came from, were a heartfelt statement of countercultural rebellion against the omnipresence of Keds. My shirts were of the button-down, reptile-free variety, and my sole winter coat was a Dacron-filled shell of shiny gold polymer. It had a stiff, box-shaped hood with a window-like opening for my face that prompted my first official Scarsdale nickname, "Spaceman."

Somehow, just as word began trickling down from junior high school about the incipient emergence of the first pubic sprouts, the universal taunt for the alien from Larchmont shifted from Spaceman to "faggot." And though I could run as fast and jump as high as almost anyone in the fourth, fifth, and eventually sixth grade, it never changed again.

I didn't really have any attraction to girls at this point—not that I had one for boys, either—so it was hard for me to disprove the underlying premise of the community-composed "Dougie's a Fem" theme song. Did everybody else know something about me that I didn't? Atter all, they couldn't have reached such a decisive and unanimous verdict by chance. By the time I turned eleven, I concluded on a fairly conscious level that the only way to fend off this onslaught of psychic terrorism was to prove I was a real boy, not a girlie boy, and certainly not a fem—whatever that meant. It was a life strategy that would prove to have diminishing returns.

I started my straight-boy self-education like most American males: with porn. I had no idea where my dad was hiding those _Playboys_ he got half-jokingly from his own dad on his 40th birthday, and actuaIly suspected my mom was making him dispose of them as soon as they arrived. My best hope was to cut her off at the pass and take one directly from the mailbox. This would be difficult, because my mom got to the mail first every day except Saturday. There was only a one out of six shot that the magazine would arrive on a Saturday, and even less that I'd be able to snag it without being noticed.

It was the morning that my brother was heading out with my parents for his second day of bar mitzvah portraits—I remember there had been some problem with the first batch—and I had been left alone. I'd have just a two-hour window for the mail to arrive, and it would _have_ to contain that month's _Playboy_. So I resorted to another mail-order item my father had purchased a few years before, a cheesy book on how to use witchcraft for power and happiness.

I retrieved the volume from a box in the attic. I found a bizarre spell in there for "wish fulfillment," which involved caressing the leaves of plants with your hands or preferably, your genitals while you concentrate on the object of desire. I considered focusing on a real woman—but a woman is not what I wanted. I wanted the next issue of _Playboy_ to be delivered within the hour. Thanks to the spell, I still believe, the magazine came before my parents and brother got back from the photographer.

But I didn't—or hadn't yet—associated pictures of female body parts with erotic excitement, and the magazine's many depictions of primary and secondary sexual anatomy weren't really helping. Sure, seeing breasts was interesting, but it wasn't really titillating, which is where I assumed that word came from. I felt a certain hot naughtiness—more of a flushness, really—whenever I'd pull the magazine from its secret hiding place and attempt masturbation. But I didn't fully understand how the pictures and my excitement were to be connected.

Somewhere between breasts and lens, photos and eyes, frontal lobe and hand, the erotic circuit between Miss July and my penis was not completed. It was far easier to masturbate alone in the bed, thinking about masturbation itself.

It was about a year later that I managed to find an image, or state of mind, that did the trick. I can still see it if I close my eyes: a short-cropped brunette, splayed against a bed of deep green leaves. She looked like a pixie or wood nymph from one of those medieval poems about knights and misty ponds in sudden clearings. Foreign. Other. But sweet. It was from _Oui_—_Playboy_'s Euro-styled sister magazine. And it had etched itself onto the printed circuit board directing my sexual response for decades to come. She was the ultimate woman because she had distinguished me as a man. She gave me my first culturally sanctioned hard-on.

What I didn't realize was that all I had truly accomplished was to train myself to reach an erection by looking at pornographic imagery. It's called classic conditioning. Jerk off looking at pictures of horses for long enough, and you'll get a hard-on looking at them, too. And I contend to this day that most of us who find porn capable of engorging a penis have done the very same thing, in one way or another. Getting aroused by looking at body parts owned exclusively by women is a learned skill, achieved primarily for the purpose of differentiating ourselves from the feminine. That's why lesbian scenes are so popular in straight porn: no penises to confuse the issue at hand.

It's the same reason why, in the fifth grade, I decided that whichever girl with whom I would attempt to "go steady" couldn't be someone I already knew well. The point was not to feel familiar or friendly with the girl, but starkly contrasted. It had nothing to do with her, really. Her purpose was merely to assert and define my masculinity. It was more about my relationships with the other guys, and my place in the prepubescent social schema, than my relationship with the female in question. She had only to prove I was not a fag.

Don't get me wrong: Fear of being a faggot has nothing to do with being afraid of homosexuality. It's got a whole lot more to do with the much simpler fear of being a woman. To the pubescents of my era, homosexuality meant something closer to no pubic hairs than men kissing men. At eleven and twelve, we were at the very crossroads of sexual differentiation. Girls would be going one way, and boys another. We wanted this mysterious division of realms to happen as quickly and painlessly as possible. Yet, at the very same time, society seemed to be collapsing these definitions in our path. My older brother's class was the first one in our junior high school where boys took Home Economics and girls took Shop. Even my dad was taking us to a "unisex" hair salon, instead of the barber. Would that turn me into a unisexual? 

At its core, for kids like me, homophobia was the fear of not being a man or, more precisely, the fear of being a woman. And who could blame us? Women have gotten a bum deal for the past couple of thousand years. In this light, who would want to be one of them, if given the choice? 

At least that's the way we developing young boys of the early 1970s understood the failure of the ERA (an aborted equal rights amendment), the pathos of Mary Richards cringing before her boss Lou Grant, as well as the professional frustrations and social passivity of our own mothers, who may have been Ivy League graduates but were still relegated to jobs that appeared to involve mostly the purchase and preparation of meat, and dressing up to play hostess for their husbands' business parties. They got face-lifts, took Valium, got abandoned for younger “trade-ins” and were left to fight for child support. Plus, they were girls. 

That's why it was so very disconcerting for me to stand, naked, in front of Drew Gershon in the locker room one winter afternoon in the seventh grade, while he explained that—from his vantage point, anyway—I was a girl. Of course Drew had just endured an extended barrage of gender-based verbal assaults himself. An awkwardly manifesting voice change had rendered his cords incapable of producing anything below mezzo soprano range for weeks, which had led to countless mocking impersonations by boys and girls alike. 

“I see you've got a penis, Rushkoff,” he said. “A little one. But in every other way you're a girl. The way you talk, the way you walk, the way you do everything. Even looking at your face right now, all I can see is a girl. You know that, Rushkoff? You're such a fem. I mean it.” His contempt for what he saw as my femininity was almost mixed with sorrow. Still, the laughter from the other boys continued long after I got my shorts on.
