Douglas Rushkoff is an author (_Program Or Be Programmed_; _Life, Inc._; _Nothing Sacred_), speaker, and documentary filmmaker (_The Merchants of Cool_, _The Persuaders_). Nobody has thought as much or as carefully about the technology we use, its programmed biases, and the effect those biases have on us as we interact with it. The day after he rushed his wife to the hospital with a busted up toe, PLGRM spoke with him about his forthcoming book and his old high school friends (spoiler alert: think _The West Wing_).

**How's your wife's toe?**

I can't really tell. I'm not a doctor so it's hard to tell. It's getting brown now.

**Did she get to a doctor?**

Yeah, we got to a doctor and they took off the rest of the toenail when we were there, so then it was just all meaty and bloody. And then, uh, it got drier and it was this nice flesh color. But now it's just like brown.

**You probably begin all your interviews this way, don't you?**

Yeah, well, with people who want to know. You can publish that. You can publish that her nail bed is now brown...

**You said something about the next thing you're going to write is going to deal with living in the present. Presencing, right?**

With the invention of text came the ability to look back

and say, “You said this then." And you could forecast Yeah, it's a little tricky, because it's a book that comes into the future: If you do this, I will do that. If we do this, out in March, and I haven't started talking about it yet. God will do that. It was a rule set that was really But, there's a lot of ways to look at it. In the context invented as we moved from a present-based, kind of you're talking about, I feel like the 20th century was Bedouin shepherd culture to an agrarian farming very ideologically based and very journey based. You culture, which again was time-based, you know, it was: know, everyone was talking about Joseph Campbell you do this, and you wait the seasons, and that and "The Hero's Journey" was sort of the peak of happens. understanding this Aristotelian quest model of, you know, of life, of business, of religion. You know, even I think that we're in an equivalent shift. I think the shift this sort of messianic myth as a myth of return ... it's a we're undergoing now is as big as the axial age shift, very narrative thing: that God was one thing, then God and, I mean, I just accept people like Karen Armstrong got broken up into all these little pieces, we each have at face value. They did more research than I did, so I a little piece of God in us, and we're moving toward a just believe--she might be wrong--that the axial age reconnecting with all the others back into that thing in happened and people went from this, you know, pre the future when we're all together. That is a linear, Theist thing or this poly-Theist to this mono-Theist narrative, time-based mythology, or time-based way of thing and text and time and progress and all these contending with feelings of incompleteness and loss other notions of western civilization happened. and isolation and all that.

present-based digital environment, we are going to

need to understand things less as story and more really tell. I'm not a doctor so it's hard to tell. It's I can't really

through these kind of present-based experiences of connectivity or insight or connection. There's going to be a lot of casualties along the way. You know, the current political response to present shock is the Tea

Party movement, this kind of child-like, knee-jerk Yeah we got to a doctor and they took off the rest of impatience, and it's much harder to have the deep intoenail when we were there, so then it was just all patience and present-ism of, say, an Occupy nesty and bloody. And then, uh, it got drier and it was movement, which is literally about occupying. We see this nice flesh color. But now it's just like brown.

from the original fundamentalist protestantism into the You probably begin all your interviews this way, sort of What Would Jesus Do, which is now-ness, you don't you?

know, it's "what would Jesus do now?" not "what did

Jesus do then?" Yeah, well, with people who want to know. You can publish that. You can publish that her nail bed is now So people move out of a historical appreciation of brown ...

for a while with, you know, to stop looking at this stuff You said something about the next thing you're as history. But it's hard. For Judaism in particular, going to write is going to deal with living in the Judaism kind of invented time, it invented progress. present. Presencing, right?
