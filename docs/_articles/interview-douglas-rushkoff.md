Douglas Rushkoff is an author (_Program Or Be Programmed_; _Life, Inc._; _Nothing Sacred_), speaker, and documentary filmmaker (_The Merchants of Cool_, _The Persuaders_). Nobody has thought as much or as carefully about the technology we use, its programmed biases, and the effect those biases have on us as we interact with it. The day after he rushed his wife to the hospital with a busted up toe, PLGRM spoke with him about his forthcoming book and his old high school friends (spoiler alert: think _The West Wing_).

**How's your wife's toe?**

I can't really tell. I'm not a doctor so it's hard to tell. It's getting brown now.

**Did she get to a doctor?**

Yeah, we got to a doctor and they took off the rest of the toenail when we were there, so then it was just all meaty and bloody. And then, uh, it got drier and it was this nice flesh color. But now it's just like brown.

**You probably begin all your interviews this way, don't you?**

Yeah, well, with people who want to know. You can publish that. You can publish that her nail bed is now brown...

**You said something about the next thing you're going to write is going to deal with living in the present. Presencing, right?**

Yeah, it's a little tricky, because it's a book that comes out in March, and I haven't started talking about it yet. But, there's a lot of ways to look at it. In the context you're talking about, I feel like the 20th century was very ideologically based and very journey based. You know, everyone was talking about Joseph Campbell and "The Hero's Journey" was sort of the peak of understanding this Aristotelian quest model of, you know, of life, of business, of religion. You know, even this sort of messianic myth as a myth of return... it's a very narrative thing: that God was one thing, then God got broken up into all these little pieces, we each have a little piece of God in us, and we're moving toward a reconnecting with all the others back into that thing in the future when we're all together. That is a linear, narrative, time-based mythology, or time-based way of contending with feelings of incompleteness and loss and isolation and all that.

I think that as we move away from this kind of clock-based, linear, analog, narrative society to a more present-based digital environment, we are going to need to understand things less as story and more through these kind of present-based experiences of connectivity or insight or connection. There's going to be a lot of casualties along the way. You know, the current political response to present shock is the Tea Party movement, this kind of child-like, knee-jerk impatience, and it's much harder to have the deep patience and present-ism of, say, an Occupy movement, which is literally about occupying. We see a little bit of it in Protestantism in America as kids move from the original fundamentalist protestantism into the sort of What Would Jesus Do, which is now-ness, you know, it's "what would Jesus do now?" not "what did Jesus do then?"

So people move out of a historical appreciation of religion, which is what I've been working on the Jews for a while with, you know, to stop looking at this stuff as history. But it's hard. For Judaism in particular, Judaism kind of invented time, it invented progress. With the invention of text came the ability to look back and say, “You said this then." And you could forecast into the future: If you do this, I will do that. If we do this, God will do that. It was a rule set that was really invented as we moved from a present-based, kind of Bedouin shepherd culture to an agrarian farming culture, which again was time-based, you know, it was: you do this, and you wait the seasons, and that happens.

I think that we're in an equivalent shift. I think the shift we're undergoing now is as big as the axial age shift, and, I mean, I just accept people like Karen Armstrong at face value. They did more research than I did, so I just believe--she might be wrong--that the axial age happened and people went from this, you know, pre-Theist thing or this poly-Theist to this mono-Theist thing and text and time and progress and all these other notions of western civilization happened.

So we move into this other thing, and I'm really writing about and thinking about the different ways that we react to that, how it changes the way we look at investments, you know, from investing in a company that's going to do well over time to investing in a derivative that's going to do well in the moment, you know, in the second. Some of these are very false hopes and some of them are hopes that might work. 

**This narrative that you began talking about, about a journey and the individual experience, for a long time people in churches have really criticized that and said, “You can't just do that. You have to be in a particular community that meets at particular times. That's the Religious aspect of the experience.” Do you think that needs to be recovered in some way?** 

It's gonna be hard. I mean, my old high school friend Aaron Sorkin is the last of the great story tellers, but when I look at his latest and greatest newest shows, “Newsroom” or something, it's nostalgia. It's nostalgia for an era when those things make sense, where that emotional arc makes sense. Life so does not work like that. So I would say, "No." If anything, we move into a kind of meta-appreciation of these kinds of stories. 

**What are the kinds of experiences that you see people reaching out for and trying to have?** 

It depends on the people. People are mostly flailing around now, looking at everything but one another for a sense of connection. So they're looking to websites and tweets and all this crap, all this electronic stuff. They're desperately trying to catch up with what they think is the moment, because they don't have any sense that they are is where it's at. 

**Is that a psychological problem?**

It's a psychological problem. It's also a problem of living in a culture that's been based on getting people to feel inadequate so they buy more stuff. What if people actually felt good about themselves? The economy would crash. 

**I'm wondering if you see particular communities that are better about this "living in the now" than the general population.**

I don't know about communities. I haven't really thought it about it that way. It's much easier to find communities who aren't, right? Like the apocalypse people, buying MREs and digging holes in the ground. Yeah, the new currency people, the people who are developing alternative currencies because those are always based in transaction and not in savings. They don't have a way to accrue value over time. You try to keep your balance near zero in an alternative trading system. There's a lot of individuals I could point to: any older person who, rather than spending time saving money for their retirement, they spend their time helping take care of their grandkids, it's because they understand that they're going to have a community that takes care of them when their time comes. When you invest your time and energy into other people, rather than into these abstract instruments, whatever they are, you end up being present-focused.

The whole problem for anybody in the church business is that we've moved from a kind of centripetal culture to a centrifugal one, a one where central institutions, guiding lights, used to attract us and now they repel us. In the best of cases, your object is to create a series of prime tones that other people would resonate with in their own little groups or for them to feel about what they're doing with you as a little group in itself.

**What if we imagined the local religious community as a platform on which individuals and groups of people who want to do good work and who are already doing good work could do it better? Does that sound like a cop-out?**

Well there's only one way to find out. Just see if they take you up on it. I think that the beauty of church over time has been its willingness to go where people are. I mean, they read Torah on market days. I remember there was a whole debate about that, that it's some kind of blasphemy, but, you know, guys like Ezra and Nehemiah were out there going, "Fuck this. People are there on Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's when we're gonna read this thing. And they don't know how to read." You're going to have to go where they are. The church, then, has to be as selfless as we're asking people to be.
