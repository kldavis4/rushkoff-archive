I used to think that kids who grew up with computers in their homes and schools would understand them really well. Better than we grownups do, anyway. Most of us only had television sets when we were kids, and maybe a simple videogame console. Computers came much later, and when they did, they offered us a whole new world of possibilities.

Television, you see, was a completely closed medium. We watched it all afternoon when we came home from school, but couldn't change anything about it. The only way we could affect what appeared on the TV was to change the channel. We could pick which program we wanted to watch, but then we just watched it. Someone else, far away, made the programs. We simply received them.

Maybe that's why it's so appropriate they called the stuff on television "programming." They weren't programming the TV sets; they were programming us viewers.

**The Digital Revolution**

The first computers most of us touched turned this whole situation on its head. They were basically like TV sets, except they also had keyboards. So now, instead of just watching what was on the TV, we could put stuff _onto_ the monitor. Television changed from a thing we watched to a thing we made.

Imagine having a telephone for many years, but only using it as a radio. You'd pick up the receiver, and listen to the news or the weather or a song. And then imagine suddenly realizing that you could talk through the thing, as well! That's how big a shift it was to see TV evolve into a computer.

how to put salami on a roll.) Using one kind of program encouraged us to work or play in a certain way, while using another encouraged something else; each program had tendencies, or biases, to ward certain behaviors, mind-sets, and approach es. We understood that, because we could read the commands in our programs, and alter them if necessary. That's why we enjoyed a sense of choice about what computers could do, and a feeling of command over them.

How programming got mysterious Software companies didn't want computer users to make programs; they wanted to sell them software. So computers started getting more and more easy to use, thanks to pre-installed programs featuring attractive buttons and windows that made it pos sible for us to get things done without typing in any commands. But in the process, computers became more difficult to program for ourselves; we could no longer see how these programs were made. (It was like buying a pre-made sandwich, instead of choosing its ingredients at the deli counter.) Today, computers are so easy to use that we don't even need instruction manuals—but at what cost?

Today, people think of an "app" as something that is downloaded from an App Store rather than something you build yourself. To those of us who know what a program really is, that's almost like saying a sand castle is something you buy. Or that swimming is something you go to the pool to watch. Or that telephones are for listening to mu sic, instead of talking to friends.

As I watched computers get easier to use but more difficult for non-programmers to understand, I wrote books for grownups explaining that, as with any family immigrating to a new culture, it's the kids who learn the language and customs the best. I described grownups as slightly disoriented “digital immigrants," and young people raised with computers and the Internet as “digital natives," who would instinctively know how digital technol ogy works. Kids would be so good at programming, I predicted, that they would one day program humanity itself out of the terrible hole into which we have dug ourselves.

Don't take your tech for granted Studies have shown that kids and your less likely than are grownups to be able to tell the difference between a news story and an adverti ment. Kids also are less able than are grow to figure what their digital technology wants fro them—which is to say, to recognize the biases with which the technology was programmed.

All technologies have biases. It's true that “guns don't kill people; people kill people.” But guns are much more likely to be used to kill people than, say, pillows are. Yes, a pillow can still be used to commit a murder, but it is much more biased to ward sleeping. Guns are more biased toward killing.

Knowing the biases of a technology before you use it can save a lot of headaches later on. If we had really considered all the biases of the automobile before we made them an American way of life, things might have turned out differently. People used to walk to work. In Europe, people still walk home for lunch. Automobiles are biased toward distance, for instance. So as we built neighbor hoods around the needs of the automobile, we ended up having to travel long distances to get to work. Now we just take that for granted as a fact of life. We need cars, and American adults actually work on average one day each week just to pay for the car that gets them there.

When we use technologies in a passive, unthinking way, we risk changing our world and behaving in ways driven by our technologies' built-in biases. For example, think of the difference between the websites Amazon and Facebook. What does Amazon want you to do? Buy stuff. So every button, every paragraph, every pop-up window you see when you visit Amazon is designed to get you to buy stuff. Facebook, on the other hand, wants you to share information about yourself-because that
