Douglas Rushkoff is one of the most widely read media critics to emerge from America in the past ten years. His thoughtful books, newspaper columns, magazine articles, television appearances and NPR¹ commentaries are intended to demystify for the man on the street the various ways we’re all manipulated by the media, popular culture and especially by commerce. _New Perspectives Quarterly_ called him “the heir to Marshall McLuhan” and like McLuhan Rushkoff’s briefed government agencies, CEOs and heads of state. His _Coercion: Why We Listen to What “They” Say_ earned him the reputation as the “go to” guy when the media needs a sharp talking head expert on matters of advertising and youth culture, and his role as correspondent for PBS's² highly regarded _The Merchants of Cool_ documentary cemented this mark.

This reputation is justly deserved. For well over a decade now Rushkoff has sent first person dispatches from the frontlines of the future with his considered musings on advertising, rave culture, technology, designer drugs, cyberspace, Wall Street’s pyramid schemes and his rejuvenated interest in his roots and the meaning of Judaism in today’s society. He’s the author of the “culture jamming” classic _Media Virus_ and Cyberia, the first book to be written about the then-emerging cyber-culture centered around San Francisco’s vibrant _Mondo 2000_ nexus and its vivid, Technicolor gurus like Terence McKenna, Timothy Leary and RU Sirius. He’s also written the novels _Ecstasy Club_ and _Bull_ (AKA _Exit Strategy_), his interactive, “open source” novel experiment that skewers scheming _dot.commies_ with good-natured satire.
