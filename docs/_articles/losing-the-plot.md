It was all thump and bleep. Simple analog computer sounds that, amplified to discotheque volume, somehow suggested a new future for the human race. A thousand kids, wearing no style in particular, dancing sexily, rhythmically, or even just spasmodically, committed themselves to pushing through until dawn and beyond. Maybe it was the drugs. Or maybe they were on to something.

My first exposure to rave culture, back in 1988, was perhaps the most significant dose of pure possibility I had experienced since my psychedelic initiation 10 years earlier.  Too young to have any direct contact with whatever the 1960s may have heralded, I was convinced we had stumbled upon something truly novel: a social scene capable of transforming the greater world around it.

In a room or field with no agenda other than a 120-beat-per-minute pulse, a few thousand intimates could liberate themselves from conventional closed-mindedness for long enough to touch something else.  While we had many names for this "other" -- from the strange attractor, to God herself -- it all boiled down to experiencing ourselves and one another in a new way: as a collective, in motion and evolving.  Blindly but boldly, we would go where no man or woman had gone before -- or so we thought.

Rave was meant to be as democratic as the Internet itself: there was no boss, anyone could participate and the more contributions from around the world the better. The object of a rave dance was to bring a large group together -- at least temporarily -- into a single, joyful, coordinated being. How much closer to the utopian dreams of the Internet can a cultural movement get?

See, the beauty of the ecstatic experience, whether you're using Ecstasy (MDMA) or not, is the freedom it offers from value systems.  Everything is delightfully up for grabs.  This is what distinguished the nineties Ecstasy kids from the sixties acid generation.  The hippies picked up signs and fought the war, their parents, and the system.  The "man" was real, and he needed to be brought down. By the 1990s, these enemies could no longer be held as real. It seemed as if the establishment's faulty foundations would crumble under their own weight. Just turn up the bass a little to speed up the process.

All we had to do was dance, and the rest would take care of itself. As we told ourselves with our music, everybody's free to feel good. We believed in the power of love, and cheered as we watched everything from the Berlin Wall to apartheid topple in its wake.

I understand why we strove for rave to not be about anything in particular. If it got too grounded in one or another brand of politics or religion, the scene would lose its healing levity. But the problem with having no agenda is that you're open to the agendas of others. The scene can be co-opted.

The Criminal Justice Act in the U.K. and over-zealous police forces in the U.S. brought about the first wave of change. Although we had a sense that it would diminish a certain something, we took our parties indoors to commercial venues. Who cares, I remember thinking, as long as we have the music and the people? A few extra bucks to the police let us keep the right chemicals in the mix, and a few more to the club owners kept the power on through morning.

But everything had changed. When we were off the map, we could keep our bearings. Traveling three hours to a rave and having to spend the night in an open field forces an intentionality all its own. The trip requires a commitment, and the event itself is a tribute to our resourcefulness.

By the 1990's, and perhaps thanks in part to the efforts of the love generation, these enemies could no longer be held as real.  In the United States, the president that most of us grew up with actually resigned his office in disgrace.  In the UK, well, the monarchy had been deconstructed by Monty Python and then reassembled using bits of their own illicit phone conversations in the tabloid press.  It seemed as if the establishment's faulty foundations would crumble under their own weight.  Just turn up the bass a little to speed up the process.

All we had to do is dance, and the rest would take care of itself.  As we told ourselves with our music, everybody's free to feel good.  We believed in the power of love, and cheered as watched everything from the Berlin Wall to apartheid topple in its wake.

So much for letting us middle class white kids run the show.

The problem with having no agenda is two-fold.  First, you have no way to gauge your progress.  Liberation of neither the soul nor the oppressed comes as surely as dawn does at the end of the party.  We'd have these terrific times, and mean truly terrific times, but it wouldn't add up to much except an occasional knowing wink in the street from a kid who you saw at that great party last week.  Second, and worse, you're open to the agendas of others.  The scene can be co-opted.

I understand why we strove for rave not to be about anything in particular.  If it got too grounded in one or another brand of politics or religion, the scene would lose its healing levity.  Besides, politics and social issues were all part of the fixed and needlessly heavy scene that had trapped our forefathers.  None of the distinctions -- right left, rich poor, black white, gay straight -- were even real.  The sooner we understood that, the better for all.

Government cast itself as the enemy to our intentions, ill-defined though they were.  The Criminal Justice Act in the UK and over-zealous police forces in the US made it clear to us that the people who make the laws were the most threatened by our dissolution of their arbitrary absolutes.  Although we had a sense that it would diminish a certain something, we took our parties indoors to commercial venues.  Who cares, I remember thinking, as long we have the music and the people?  A few extra bucks to the police let us keep the right chemicals in the mix, and a few more to the club owners kept the power on through morning.

But now we were becoming part of the system we had so successfully evaded for so long.  When we were off the map, we could keep our bearings.  Traveling three hours to a rave and having to spend the night in an open field forces an intentionality all its own.  The trip requires a commitment, and the event itself is a tribute to pulling ourselves up by our own bootstraps.

Today, you can find something calling itself a rave almost every night of the week at a pub within walking distance.  Some of these parties are taking place in the very same rooms where your parents went every Friday night after a long week of work to let off steam -- with booze and boogie instead of tryptamines and Tricky.  By current estimates, a million hits of E are consumed every weekend in the UK.  If that's really true, then why is club culture so devoid of everything that E appeared to herald?

For one, because E just doesn't work if you take it every week.  Sure, the chemical has effect.  But when taken in weekly doses, the empathic qualities quickly give way to simple stimulation.  There's simply not enough serotonin in the brain to support this much induced bliss.  The drug tends to act more like speed, provoking the same sorts of hooliganism that everyone else succumbs to on their weekend binges.

More significantly, rave deteriorated because we allowed the movement to become part of business as usual: a weekend release, no different from the pub crawls that characterize the experience of any other worker who, given a break to blow off some steam, can go back to work on Monday morning without complaining.

No, it wasn't entirely our fault.  Even in America we were getting busted for throwing parties anywhere but in a sanctioned club.  Mainstream culture did not have the apparatus for dealing with a non-commercial social phenomenon as big as rave was getting.  But we are all to blame for failing to figure out exactly which parts of the rave experience were most important to bring indoors.

Rave parties had been part of what could only be considered a gift economy.  Collectives would form spontaneously, collecting enough money to rent a sound system and print up some flyers.  If there were extra cash from a successful event, the money would go to pay for a few meals for the organizers and the rest towards the next party.

While the cops and government officials hated the idea of kids doing drugs and making noise in abandoned spaces and remote fields, business hated it even more.  The young people who should be buying alcohol, top-forty records, and paying for admittance to the disco were instead participating in an alternative economy -- dropping psychedelics, exchanging remix tapes, and driving to the country.

When rave became a club event, it merged this gift economy with the business of nightclubbing -- and this is where it all went bad. We all know the story by now.  Clubs make money selling drinks, but kids at a rave ingest E, not booze.  The solution?  Sell bottled water to the dehydrated trippers.  To insure this lucrative business, club owners began confiscating any water that the kids brought themselves, and shutting off the water in the bathroom.  Thus, the first vastly publicized deaths due to "ecstasy overdoses," which were really just cases of simple dehydration.  The kids weren't killed by the drugs, but by the water sellers.

The rise of the commercial rave also compromised the very real but unstated ethic of the gift economy that had ruled until then.  Rave promoters, initially forced to raise their prices to pay for venues, learned that a few more dollars added to the price of ticket could yield tremendous profit.  Promoters who were used to breaking even found themselves tens of thousands of pounds or dollars richer by morning.  This drew new legions of would-be promoters into the ring, whose glossy flyers would compete with one another for attention at the record shop.

What had been a spontaneous expression of community turned into good old-fashioned American free market competition.  With five or more separate clubs competing for the same audiences on the same nights of the week, distrust and ill-will between rave posses ruled.  DJ's who used to be anonymous became headliners, who performed on stage under spotlights.  The number of gigawatts of bass became an advertising pitch.  Promoters worked hard to prove through their graphics and slogans that they were the exclusive purveyors of the "original" integrity that defined the great raves of '88. But no matter how good the sound, the lights, the DJ, or the drugs, the commercial parties were missing the ingredient that used to hold it all together: community.

By reducing its participants to mere consumers, rave lost its claim to the sacred.  As economic and business forces became the driving force of the culture, the imperative to have profound experiences was replaced by a financial imperative to sell more tickets in less time to more people.  We no longer took weeks to prepare both practically and mentally for the ritual.  As with psychedelics, this lack of preparation reduced sacred experiences to mere entertainments -- appropriately listed alongside concerts and movies in the weekend newspaper.

In retrospect, what made rave so revolutionary was its economics.  The reason we felt so removed from the workaday reality is that we had disconnected ourselves from the cycle of consumption and production that degrades and dehumanizes so much of the rest of our daily experience.  Just as Wired magazine reduced the community-inspiring Internet to a shopping mall called the World Wide Web, commercial interests reduced of the rave movement to an "Electronica" category in the record shop.

It was not our existence outside the law that made rave so special, but our separation from corporate culture and the market economy.  Like a Sabbath, the rave was a holy day during which no one bought or sold anything -- and if they did, it was in a manner absolutely at odds with the gross national product.

The absence of an agenda was not our agenda at all.  We were positively striving towards a celebration of the sacred.  Instinctually, we realized that this sacredness would be compromised by business and politics as they were currently being practiced.  Government made our chosen rituals illegal and business made us pay for sacred space.

Business used the power of government's enforcers to drag our parties indoors, and while we managed to hold onto our stashes, we didn't hold onto much else.   We simply didn't know enough about what we doing to fight for the part that mattered.
