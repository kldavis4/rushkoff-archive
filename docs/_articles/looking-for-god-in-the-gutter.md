COMICS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT mythic narratives and beings: Superman is nothing if not Godlike, the Marvel Universe is virtually a pantheon, and even Charlie Brown was everyman's Job. But recently, writers have been taking this mythic potential more literally by making comics explicitly religious: Virgin's _India Authentic_, Osamu Tezuka's _Buddha_, R. Crumb's _Book of Genesis Illustrated_, and my own _Testament_, to name just a few. Why do so many writers choose to explore their relationship to the gods through comics?

There are plenty of answers--as many as there are comics, I imagine. But really, beyond the iconic representations, the history of superheroes, or the protection offered writers in a supposedly "kids'" medium, what is it about comics themselves that make them such an appropriate venue for Bible and Upanishads alike?

The gutter.

That's right--the space between the panels. The parts of the page no one even pays attention to. Those white, empty lines separating one panel from another, one moment in comic narrative from the next. It's there in that gap that the magic of comics occurs.

In one panel, Clark Kent heads into the phone booth; in the next, he's Superman flying above Gotham City. Between those two incarnations, a simple gutter in which nothing is drawn, yet the entire transmogrification of man to superhero has taken place. It's the closest thing in comics to transubstantiation, and it happens in the unseen crack between two discreet moments. It is everything, yet nothing.

This is core premise of comics, the art of sequential narrative. Our stories and their characters do not move in a line, as in theater or even literature, but through a series of windows. Frozen instants. These are the ticks of the clock, but not the spaces between each one where life actually happens or the story actually occurs.

As such, a comic requires a leap of faith from its readers every time they move from one panel to the next. We move to the next panel and must absorb it before we even understand its connection to the panel before. Only then are we able to relate it to the narrative of which it is a component part. Picture, word, then connection.

This gives the author an amazing opportunity: to instill word and image into a reader's mind before the reader has a context for this information. This is the tremendous power behind comics' ability to generate cultural iconography--to create modern mythology.

happens: the reader is asked to partic1pate, willfully, 1n the assembly of a

whole from the parts. It is the reader who makes sense of the narrative,

connecting the panels and turning them from separated moments into

a living story.

It's this act of reader participation - this transformation of sequence

into story- that implicates readers so much more fully in the very

telling of the story they think they're reading. The readers aren't just

going along for the ride, but providing the propulsion forward. They

are rewarded with a sense of completion and sense-making every time

they move their eyes from one panel to the next, implicitly agreeing

with the sense they have made.

For me, the gutter has always been such a powerful yet unrecognized

element in the form that I decided to make its function explicit in my

own work. For my own Bible-based comic series Testament I chose to

Religion attempts to codify and transmit the eternal to creatures who

are (at least for the time being) trapped in the present. It means to

make human beings who are trapped within panels aware of the gutter

beyond - even for just a fleeting moment, in the obscure shadows of

inference.

And this is what attracts so many writers to comics as the ideal medium

through which to express their own immortal intimations. The panels

are winks: building blocks that, in themselves, may not amount to more

than any other storytelling device, but collectively create a multidimen-

sional rendering. Once they lock into place in the mind of the reader ' they assemble, like a Kabbalistic Tree or I Ching sequence, into an

informational matrix of a higher order than can be put into wo d r s.
