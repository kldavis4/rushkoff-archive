COMIX

\-

\-\~ -------

Testament, by media theorist and culture critic Doug

Rushkoff, is serialized as a

monthly comic'book from

DC/Vertigo and then collected

into a graphic novel every

five or six issues-Testament Volume Two: West

of Eden was just recently released. The series

ranks among the triumvirate of Neil Caiman's

Sandman, Grant Morrison's Invisibles and Alan

Moore's Promethea, and alongside Jack Kirby's

'70s psychedelic cosmologies/comics, The New

Gods and the Eternals.

"Originally, I wanted to do the Eternals," says

Rushkoff. That was my first pitch-I wanted to

play with a big universe like that. The Eternals

wasn't available, but it turned out that the Bible

still was. Rather amazing, given how much

mythology it has to offer. I mean, the Bible is a

bigger universe than even Jack Kirby's."

Regatding the aforementioned trio, Rushkoff

says, "You're talking about the trippiest and most

comic-specific uses of the medium in the past 20

路 years. That's the whole point of it, for me: to write a

story that can only\~ told properly in this medium.

That means pushing the medium itself-doing the

unexpected with narrative and layout, in order to

dimensionalize the whole experience. Every great

comic needs to be the one that did something not

just with comics, but to comics."

Rushkoff retelis the book of Genesis by way of

a sophisticated parallel narrative,

h路alf of which

takes place in biblical times and the other half

in the near future. For example, in Testament, we

not only see Abraham and Isaac,路 but we also see

Professor Ahm Stern in the near future pushing

his son to have a mandatory RFID (radio frequ

_

en- 1

cy identification)_ implanted. Ultimately, Professor

Stern helps his son evade the requirement rather

than sacrificing his freedom. There is a third

narrative that runs perpendicular to the other

two, with gods acting out of time and in'fluencing

goings-on from outside the panels. When they

reach into the panels, their actions are perceived

as elements or consuming emotions. A godly

finger breaks 路one comic book panel to reach

tQward Abraham, transforming into the flame

that_ lights the torch at the sacrificial altar beside

him. Rushkoff edges into what some might deem

subversive territory when the near-future parallel

narrative starts to veer away from its biblical

counterpart; he shows that Lot's wife doesn't

\~lways have to look back. "The point is that the

story is still being written, it's not a closed book."

Rushkoff explains.

Could Rushkoff imagine Testament ever actually being taught in Hebrew school?

"I know of a few rabbis' lists online where it's

a regular topic of conversation, so that's another

form of beit mid rash, where they're finding use

for the book," he says. "But the sex and violence

make it a bit inappropriate for officially teaching

to kids."
