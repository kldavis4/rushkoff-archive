Algorithms, Al and surveillance capitalism are

colonising the human mind and it's time for us to

resist by rising to the occasion of our own humanity,

says renowned author and media theorist Douglas 1

Rushkoff. William Alderwick plugs into the matrix

I fi nished the first draft. Wired magazine had launched. Wired was the

first magazine other than

Mondo 2000 to be saying: •something is

coming that's bigger than just PC Magazine's story about new RAM.'

"Only this very psychedelic thing I had been writing about, what

fonothy Leary was calling the technological LSD, was being framed

and major cultural institutions that shape our lives. For Rushkoff,

software engineers are framing us as the problem and technology as

the solution. Not only are we in danger of writing ourselves our of the

equation, he says, but we're faced with the prospect of the equations

(AI as the first technology capable of writing its own algebra, if you

will) originating and deploying their own tactics against us.

Rushkoff says being human is a fundamentally, inescapably

collective endeavour. lt is a team sport. From the neurons up, what

differentiates us as a species is connection, which has enabled us to

evolve biologically and socially to dominate the planet. We need ro

rum the narratives and values that inform the digital architectures and

infrastructures of our world away from those that individuate, alienate

and isolate us, he argues, and instead towards rebuilding h_uman

connections and community. Team. Human. Two words with a

certain ring to them, at once pithy and powerful. .

levels. For example, how door-to-door salesmen shadow the breathing

panems and cadence of their marks. mimicking postures and gestures

these kinds of techniques were starting to be adapted into the nascent

digital ecologies and used to behaviourally engineer situations onlinc .

"Coercion was saying: 'There 's an arms race between us and the

controllers. They are upscaling their tactics, using digital technology,

they're embedding the digital infrastructure with regression and

(behaviour scientist) BJ Fogg started his 'captology' department

at Stanford.

'"And then the rest of the books have really been about that power

relationship: it's program or be programmed. If we don"t understand the

landscape and they do, then they're going to control us. If you're not the

real user. then you're the used.

"'Team Human is meant to be an optimistic call to anns rather

than a critique of technology. 1 thought it could augment the human

organism. strengthen our cultural vitality. rather than just dcconstruct

and reify the centrality of digital control mechanisms."

ln his writings Rushkoff often uses a technique a bit like those

'Rubin"s vase' optical illusions where shifting the focus of your eyes

can reveal either a vase or two faces looking at each other. By flipplllg

a narrative on its head, lllverting •figure' and 'ground' (i.e background),

he reveals things we·ve overlooked in a situation - bow. for example ,

money, automobiles or universal education have changed us and our

lives in unanticipated and counterintuitive ways. often not for the better

and against their original llltcotions. Automobiles, he observes. were

first marketed to the working classes through the aspirational freedom

of enjoying the open roads on their oewly won two days off at the

weekend - the Fordist utopia. A couple of generations later, with

gridlock in urban centres and exhaust emissions choking the air. the

automobile has transfonned American towns by enabling the exodus

from civic centres and main streets into soulless suburbs. To have any

IRL connection or community now necessitates having a car. ls that

freedom. or a straitjacket?

Another of Rusnkoff's favourites is universal education: launched

as compensation for industrial work and presented as a celebration of

human dignity through sclf-bcnenncnt and knowledge for its own sake.

Instead, he suggests. education has become an extension of work itself.

externalising corporations' costs of training staff. Our schooling is now

about our utilitarian value as potential employees ( our salary potential.

"My experience comes from theatre;· he offers when asked about

these shifts of perspective. ,. Almost every Shakespeare play has a

meta-theatrical moment, a play within the play. Or someone observing

a scene from the outside, spying and they make some comment like: 'I

"I was always interested in those kinds of reframings. McLuhan talked about the same thing, how in a new media age the prior medium becomes the content of the llCJlt one. Now television is

the content of the internet.

Rushkoff"s won.Js remind me o f un interview I did with Paul Laffoley. who was complaining about string theorists adding more and more dimensions into their theories (we're nt 10 or 11 now). And Laffolcy was like: "They're adding these new dimensions like filing drawers but they 're not thinking about what it's like to be alive in there " . I tell Rushkoff bow that always spiked me What . is the thing that lives and breathes within this space? What's the experience like inside the drawer?

"And that's my problem with most movies, TV and novels now " , Rushkoff says. 'They're adding layers of complexity - now we '11 tell the story backwards in time, or on three different time loops - but it's just postmodern pyrotechnics more than a real cxplontion of what's the actual lived experience."

Which is the essence of storytelling, I suppose . "You would think, yeah. There's something much simpler that we're not reckoning with and that's why 'Team Human' , in some ways,

is pathetically naive or simplistic."

Last summer, in the upstairs bar of a pub round the back of King's Cross railway station in London, I pressed a folded-up copy of the second issue of Good Trouble into Rushkoff's hands. As be opened out the broadsheet, his eyes were

wde i and smiling through the hubbub of drinking, chatter and music that filled the room A . talk earlier that evening at the British Library, moderated by the Guardian columnist George Monbiot. was my first encounter with the ideas of Team Human. even though Rushkoff had been doing his podcast for several years. It began after he took a shon break from writing after landing the role of professor of media theory and digital economics at Queens College, City University of New York, in 2014, serving as a 'listening tour' through which he could

sec what other people were talking about and use his platform to give them voice. The ideas for the book, informed by the podcast interviews, evolved out of his own monologues on the show, "a distillation of that year of public thinking".

As we chatted in that bar, half-shouting through the din in the bar's half-light, a wariness brought on by the nationalistic antiimmigrant rhetorics of Brexit made me ask: who gets to define who

gets on the team, who gets to define the human ' ' ? Within the book, there's not really a definition of what being human means per sc. Rushkoff talks of it in a very natural, almost naive way. The closest he gets to a defining quality is that through our language we 're able

to bind time , literally replaying and reliving past events through storytelling, and thus pass knowledge between generations. There's

a radical openness suggested by this lack of definition, that being human is whatever you want it to be, and that that's the point. "I think the jury's still out on what humans are, you know?" he says. "And I think that's okay. The only ones who really want

me to define what being human is are the artificial intelligence people. And if I can't give them a metric for what humanity is, then humanity doesn't deserve a place in their future.

"It's almost like the part that we can't articulate is the part that's the most imponant. The closest I can say to it is: the formal

cause of human beings is the soul. And that's the part that's just

so confounding to capitalism and to science. But soul is not some

supernatural thing, you know? You could argue it's the same thing that Al Green or Otis Redding have What . is that? It's the thing that

goes away when you auto-tune their voices."

In the book, Rushkoff points out that resistance is a metaphor from a bygone age, whether of the political, activist or Star Wars

variety. In a digital media environment, there is no resistance as

attenuation. Binary logic reduces everything to either one or other.

"Even with Extinction Rebellion, there's a certain

I do think we're more human when we're at play,

and that part of rappon is a playfulness."

What emerges through Team Human is not a

• revolutionary message of ovenuming the tables

and violently taking to the streets. What Rushkoff

suggests in terms of action is almost prosaic: being

visible, engaging in protests, participating politically

and developing new platforms, engaging purposely

with the natural world, reforming corrupt institutions

and building better ones. The core message seems to

be that we just need to participate more.

"It's not an activist blueprint," he admits. "It's

a call for something more fundamental than that.

I would think activism, direct activism, social

change and social justice work would be an obvious

next step. But I'm asking that people retrieve these

essential human values, and that then necessitates

message. But if you don't value humanity, if y\~u don't _v ue

yourself and these connections with other.;, then I don t know if that

will ever get there."

As he points out, technology itself doesn't inherently want

anything. Whatever drive or purpose it has comes entuely from

the software that we program it with, from the underlying logical

value systems that we design and utilise it within._The real target _of

Team Human is this underlying value system: capitalism. Extracuve

and exploitative capitalism. The book is an attempt to shift our

pmpective, inven figure and ground, to help us shift our values

away from capitalist value extraction, from a winner-takes-all to

an all-take-the-winnings kind of logic.

"I'm arguing for pre-distributing the means of production,"

Rushlcoff says . .. What does it mean for the workers to own and for

n them us to own the world? A few corporations beginning in the days of

the British East India Trading Company have been gobbling up more ival

Detuate and more of our reality. And this process has been naturalised. Now

beings have become just another medium for corporate extraction.

Our whole race, our whole planet, our whole everything has been

surrendered to a very shon-sighted economic model that was

developed to slow the rise of the middle class in the 11th century.

If we are going to keep that model, if we want to believe in that

model more than ourselves, then we're about to pay the price.

"I try to make a distinction between revolution and renaissance.

A revolution is a tum of the cycle. A renaissance is the retrieval of

old ideas in a new context. I trace a lot of our current problems back

to the last renaissance. For all the cool things about it, it was also the

retrieval of very specific ideas from ancient Rome and Greece about

centrality and control and the repression and obsolescence of women

magic, indigenous people, spirit and peer-to-peer economics. All the '

things that were forcibly suppressed during that time really need to

be retrieved now, or we all die .

'\~thers' and there were others at college. But honestly, for a tong

tune the tell-tale marker for finding a fellow traveller was, did theY

have psychedelic experience? And I'm not saying that psychedelic

experience is required to understand the world. .. it's just that in

80s, Republican, Reagan America, if you were one of the 12 people

at Princeton who took acid in 1980, it meant a whole lot of other

things about you at the time. It meant that you listened to Brian Eno.

That you were already exploring these 'figure-ground' relationships

between humans and society. It meant that you had read WilliaDl

Burroughs and thought about the deconstruction of media and cutand-paste. These people had been turned on to the system's iterative

reality and the whole notion that we are participating actively in the

creation of reality.

"But then, more recently, as I started writing Team Human, the

notion of 'the others' expanded from the others who have had the

great psychedelic experience to the true others, the kids with the

Make America Great Again hats ... These are human beings, and

I keep arguing that we've got to see them as humans if we want

them to see Mexican immigrants as humans."

The destruction wrought by European colonialists led Native

Americans to conclude that the invaders must have a disease:

wettiko, a delusional belief born from people's inability to see

themselves as enmeshed and interdependent parts of their natural

environment. This disconnect leads them to see nature as something

to be conquered and consumed rather than emulated and sustained.

Team Human argues that the only way to escape this sickness is to

shift perspective, widen context, re-situate the terms of debate, invert

figure and ground, reverse the polarity. The whole book is an attempt

to refocus our attention on what matters to us, on what makes us

human, and on what we truly care about. We are not the problem;

we're the solution. Rushkoff calls for us to reconnect with the ground

on which we stand, the communities we live in and the people with

whom we conspire - literally those we breathe together with.

After our interview, an email pops up in my inbox from Rushkoff

perhaps embodying the uncomplicated, open-handed outreach at '

the heart of his Team Human message. It reads simply: "Let's stay

friends." Go find the others.
