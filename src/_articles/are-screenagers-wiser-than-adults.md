Are 'screenagers' wiser than adults? 

Absolutely, says the author of a new book, who sees cyberspace preparing kids for tomorrow

EFORE AMERICA INSTALLS V-chips in every TV set and padlocks on all the Segas, we'd better take a good look at why kids devote so much energy to channel- surfing, cruising the Interact and play ing Room, as well as the positive effects cyberniania may have on them, 

Kids' fascination with new media is preparing them for the workpluce and society of tomorrow. If we try to learn from their example, we, too, might gain skills necessary to thrive in a highly tech- nological and chaotic future. 

Kids are natives to a modiaspace where the rest of us are more 

immigrants. They were born into a world full of remote controls, Joy- sticks and computer networks, and under. stand the language and customs of this world better than we ever could hope to. Just as Immigrant parents look to their children to learn how to behave and even how to think, we should look to our chil dren for cues on how to adapt to uur new, some- times baffling, media environment. 

ads and sitcoms, we are held in the sponsors' spell and "programmed" with their agendas. But a kid who feels himself being coerced simply hits the remote, pulling himself out of pas sivity into an active relationship to the TV image. He surfs away before he's caught in the spell. 

The flip side of his decreased toler- ance for passive programming--what we usually think of as a decreased attention span is actually an

RHYTHM OF THE FUTURE Most of us reflexively bemoan the channel-surfing habits of our children. Why can't they just watch one program all the way through? What's wrong with their attention spans? But instead of focus. ing on what children are losing, let's look at what they are gaining. 

Traditional programming appeals to our hearts and wallets by hypnotiz ing us into a passive stupor. Captive to the lincar, emotional storylines of our

Our children are already more mature media consumers than we are. By play ing video games, they increase their hand-eye coordination and interface comprehension. Winning a game is really just mastoring a new piece of software. More important, our kids are demystify- ing the television image for themselves. With joysticks in their hands, they have a fundamentally different appreciation for the picture on the screen: It can be changed. While adults perceive news piped into their homes as Indisputable fact, our kids know the truth: The image is up for grabs. 

THE RICH MEANING OF VIDEO VIOLENCE 

Further empowering them, the aver age American teen's bedroom is as well-equipped as a state-of-the-art newsroom was 20 years ago. A com- puter, a modem and a TV give them Instant access to global information. By navigating the World Wide Web, they learn how to move through a discontin- tious realm of data and opinions, as well as how to distinguish between the two. 

Not surprisingly, our kids' favorite media content also is filled with coping strategies for the world all of us soon will inhabit. While parents can glean little more than violence from a show like Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, It deals quite cloquently with some meaningful core issues. The underlying theme of the Power Rangers is evolution as a team sport. The young Rangers only reach full power when they mutate together into a giant, cooperatively controlled robot. The monsters they fight aro controlled by the evil Lord Zed, a victim of his own technological excesses who must remain connected to a complex life-support apps- ratus. He symbolizes the sad conse- quence of selfishly exploited technology. Even the most violent video games, Continued on next page

Social theorists sinee Aristotle have understood that ritualized violence relieves the need for the real stuff. (Even the Shuo Lin priests study kung fu along with their Buddhist texts.)

GIVE KIDS THE CONTROLS 

If nothing else, let's put to bed the myth that it's our kids who, left to their own devices, will inevitably seck out the most violent media. Our new generation of fledgling screenagers is not making the games currently on the shelves of Toys "R" Us. They were designed by adults using interface technology atiginally implemented for war simulation by the military. Once our kids grow into game designers themselves, we'll be able to make a more accurate assessment of the effect of all this mediated play oli their violent inclinations. 

The real challenge before us is to resist further insulating our kids. Instead, let's put the tools in the hands of our children unci see what they do with them. Whether it's game construction kits where kids can fashion their own adventures on the computer, or camcorders where they can make their own JV shows, kids should have the power and opportunity to design the enter- talment environments that sult their needs, 

This is where the efforts of truly concerned parents should go. 

We might be pleasantly sure prised by the generation we have spawned. They are, after all, the fat-
