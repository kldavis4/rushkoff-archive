Will computers make books obsolete? Of course not. No. They won't. Or so I keep telling myself. I'm embarking on yet another book tour in my now four-year-old career as a published author (there was a book back in 1990, but that one doesn't count). l've been able to witness, first-hand, the way computers and the Internet have influenced the book world's reading habits, buying patterns, production cycles, and marketing decisions. While these technologies have had a somewhat negative impact on certain aspects of the publishing industry, they will only help the book, authors and readers in the long run.

publishing industry, !hey will only help lhc

book, authors and readers in lhc long run.

Flf'Sl off, computers don 'I make people

read less; they make us read more. Most of

the kids I know who are lucky ( or wealthy)

enough to be onlinc have astonishing literacy

slcills. No matter how visual !he world wide

web might get in its inletfacc. so far it's still

a word-based medium when you follow

anything through or try to glean any real

information.

Funhcr. because Intemcl users need 10

type everything !hey wish 10 communicate,

!hey have developed extremely subtle forms

of wriru:n communication. I'm DOI just

lalking about 'cmoticons' like the :). I

believe that online inteniclion acrually makes

a penon 's writing better. People engaged in

heated discussions in USENET groups or

bulletin-board conferences - whether !hey·re

arguing about cold fusion or Counncy Love

\- are forced to spar with language . I can tell

when I've received e-mail from people

raised 00 !he lntemct because !heir sentences

8" dense with innuendo, compensating for

lhc limited time and keysttokes they can

dcvocc to !be wk. Kids online today write

much bec1cr 1ban I did at lhcir age.

But just because !be written word is alive

and well. ii doesn ·1 necessarily mean that !he

printed page. bound to hundreds of othen

and glued in10 a cardboard cover, will

survive. too. lbcre arc only so many mediahours in a day, the pessimists warn. and

book-reading takes up too many for ii to

remain a viable formal. Digital text retrieval

systems yet-lo-be invented will allow for the

downloading of an entire text in seconds, and

people will be able 10 read !hem on small

electronic clipboards.

Perhaps. However. just when ii appears

that a new medium is going lo replace its

prcdcccssor. WC tend 10 figure oul the lrUC

value of the older. Expens !hough! Iha! the

vidcocasselle would pul the traditional movie

house 001 of business. Instead, ii turned the

general public into amalCUr film historians.

while giving cinema ownen an idea of what

they could offer us that videotapes can '1:

giant screens. THX sound. glamorous

lobbies. and an evening out oflhe house.

A new medium replaces an old one only if

it docs everything better. Computcr nctworlcs

and CO-ROMS can do certain things better than

books. They arc better for rapid retrieval of

database information. and serve well as

encyclopedias. dictionaries, newspaper

libnirics. and catalogues where searching and

other nonlinear ia.,ks arc the most important.

Whal online text has dcmonstraled to us.

!hough. is that books arc more than

repositories for information. lbcy arc objects.

and they arc meant to be experienced as such.

The usual function of a dictionary is to

provide the meaning of a word. 1bc function

of a book is 10 provide a reading experience.

II is more than a 1ran5mission of dala: it is a

transmission of essence.

Not !hat computers don ·1 transmit their

own sort of essence. too. CD-ROM games like

Myst proved so successful because !hey

capcured something essential about the

seemingly random. user-directed navigational

path of a compu1er world. Myst was a

funhouse-stylc experience where. freed from

the linear constraints of literary fiction, the

storytellers could let the usen wander around

a descned island and discover clues for

lhcmselves. This style was dicwed by the

particularly free-form quality of the

computer-game medium.

Books offer a different kind of

experience. This experience has as much to

do wilh the pages and ink as ii docs with the

words themselves. A book has totemic value.

Like a photograph or a piece of jewellery, lhc

impression of ink on paper creates a physical

connection wilh its author.

This is why the publishing industry, in

response 10 the advcn1 of digital text. has

begun to emphasize the design and

production of the books lhcmsclvcs. Most

publishers use acid-free 'archival' quality

paper, and devote more time and energy 10

!he choice of typeface and cover an.

Likewise. we authors arc being forced lo

realize 1ha1 our books had better

communicate something more lhan a web

page docs. too. We have to understand what

ii is a book can do, and either fulfil !hat

purpose or quit cutting down trccs for no

good reason.

Computers and !he lntcmel may have

1a11ght_ us ( or at least reminded us of) lhc

special ability of books to provide a kind of

CJtpcricncc you can't get anywhere else.

Books have souls, or so romantics like me

tend 10 think. However pro-technology and

pro-future I gel. I still have a deep love for

printed and bound texts. (Maybe !he fact that

writing books pays my rent has something to

do with ii, 100.) Neither the ln1emc1 nor

computers really threaten !he book as an an

form. As long as aulhon keep in mind what

their books can do that no other medium can .

!heir wortcs will be appreciated.
