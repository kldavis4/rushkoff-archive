Ever since he linked super-sticky trends with the genetic concept of "memes" in his book _Media Virus_, Doug Rushkoff's rep as a top pop pundit has been scarily out of control. His new book, Get Back in the Box: Innovation from the Inside Out is full of advice for floundering corporate innovators trying to think outside the box: get back in it.

In fact, _Get Back_ picks up where Rushkoff's previous books left off, describing the media and business as a bazaar where individuals, cultures and institutions create, share, and propagate each other's values. Now Rushkoff is putting his spin on corporate innovation with a new question: Is fun the key to business success?

Most people in business think of innovation as something new, different, and outside the scope of what they've done before. Real innovation is actually mining deeper into your true sources of competency and expertise to find new ore that you then bring up to the surface and apply.

You've got to love what you do to innovate. It's not about extrinsic rewards. "Compensation" is a horrible word for payment because what are you getting compensated for? The pain of work!

The problem with the former understanding of innovation is that it's anathema to expertise or continuity. It's seen as turning a page, or stepping into a whole new world. That's only desirable if you hate what you're doing.

People who experience innovation as an abundant resource have no problem sharing what they've learned with anybody, collaborating with people who are supposed to be their competition, and letting in all sorts of influences. They understand that their employees and customers are the great experts in everything they're doing.
