THE YEAR WAS 2002 AND I WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF A GLOWING COMPUTER SCREEN AFTER SCHOOL, PUMPED UP ON ENOUGH DOCTOR-PRESCRIBED RITALIN TO KILL A RHINOCEROS WHILE SWITCHING BETWEEN CHAT ROOM WINDOWS, PHOTOSHOP, SIMCITY 2000, AND READING "CYBERIA: LIFE IN THE TRENCHES OF HYPERSPACE," MY OBLIVIOUS AND SHELTERED TEENAGE-SELF LEARNED ABOUT THE UNDERGROUND COUNTER-CULTURE BEHIND THE DANCE MUSIC I HAD BEEN DRIVING MY PARENTS NUTS WITH FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS. I LEARNED ABOUT THE CREATION OF THE INTERNET AND THE RISE OF NEW AGE OUT OF INDISUTRIAL AND THE GAIA HYPOTHESIS. FAST FORWARD 21 YEARS LATER, AND I HAD THE MOST EXTREME PLEASURE OF SPEAKING WITH THE AUTHOR OF CYBERIA HIMSELF--DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF. HIS MOST RECENT BOOK, "TEAM HUMAN," TAKES A LOOK AT WHERE WE'VE ENDED UP TODAY, AND HOW WE'VE GOTTEN THERE, AND HOW TO MOVE FORWARD...

REAGAN: I discovered you in my senior year of high school in 2002. My final senior paper for my Ethics of Science and Technology class posed the question, "Is cyberspace a pre-existing physical space we've tapped into through the use of computers much like we've tapped into observable space with the use of telescopes?" Your book "Cyberia: Life In The Trenches of Hyperspace" was one of the books I stumbled upon during my countless hours of research. Since then you've written other books like "Life, Inc.," where you traced the historical evolution of the corporation from the middle ages to present time, and most recently, you've just published your new book "Team Human," which addresses a number of topics pertaining to the anti-human agenda that's found its way into modern technology and society.

I grew up a techno-junkie. My first experience online was in the fifth grade in 1995, and I was immediately introduced to software piracy and hacking--I used to design art and macros for AOL hacker groups. So I'd like to ask, now that we have awareness concerning the pitfalls of social media, news media, our government, and an out of control, unsustainable consumer driven, overly competitive winner-takes-all society, do you have any ideas how to address these things? Being that technology has become so ingrained into the fabric of our lives, how do we imagine something outside of that?

DOUGLAS: You may even want to flip that. Technology's gotten very good at making the imaginary appear more substantive than the real. The easy part of the answer to your question is we don't have to imagine something outside the technical. Reality itself is outside that. Touching another person or looking into their eyes or breathing the air or experiencing a child--any of those things will reconnect you to the real pretty damned fast. Pain also connects you to the real. No matter how online you are and someone cuts off your toe--you feel it right away. Just get food poisoning, and all of a sudden reality is back.

I do see the value when you use a word like imagination. There's value in painting pictures or visualizing reality for people in such a way that they're not afraid to experience it. Now, they watch TV or go online, and reality seems like fascism and Trump and poison water and all these things.

Part of the original function of the news media was to scare people about what was going on outside their homes so that they stayed inside watching TV--and we knew this before the internet. If you put on any local news show it was always, "three black youths attack middle-class white person," and it was again and again and again and again--and in part that was to get people to watch the news. If they think there's some kind of danger, they're going to be more willing to tune in.

R: It's wild-my youngest cousin

started experimenting with LSD with

some friends of his when he was 17 or

18\. He was running around with these high-society kids from elite politically connected families in Austin, Texas. I

don't know if you remember the guy

Dick Cheney shot in the face on the hunting accident, but his grandkid

was one of my cousin's best friends ...

Now. these kids would drop acid, go

hunting in the woods with AK-47s, shoot up small animals, scare the shit

out of their friends who were firsttime trippers, and I'm hearing them

brag about this like it's

think the problem is that people

o. tand pohtlCS as this once· und\~our-years consumer choicee\~er American Idol idea of voting t is he one you like. And while it's

(\~\~rtant. it's no substitute for civic

engagement.

_

I think people have lost uack of c1v1cs. Civics happens

ve locally in

_

a bottom-up way, and

th\~needs of different communities

\~rcolate up to the national leaders

through local action. I think it's important to keep track of both, but I think people spend too much energy

on then presidential candidates . because that's the set bid-your kmd of coke or Pepsi, McDonald's or Burker

King . At this point, I pretty much know

rrn going to vote for whoever's not

rrump. Now that I know that, if I look at the Democratic candidates

and am asked which one I'd like to

influence, Elizabeth Warren seems

to have a whole lot of substance that

most of the others don't. There's a few

that look interesting-and because I

am who I am, I'm trying to help give the right language to some of these democratic candidates about how to

get past the socialism label and start looking at: how do you predistrib

ute

the means of production rat

her than

redistribute the spoils of capitalism. It's not about taxing people after the fact or giving

UBI \[universal basic income\]. it's abo

ut who owns

at, and who owns these factories and

these towns,

and

distrib

ute that

ownership. I want to help give them the nght langua

ge. How

do you move from a growt

h-based economy to a

flow-based eco

nomy?,_. Beyond that. I spend most of

my poh\\1cal energy locally, and I think thats where

people can really make

a difference. It's really easy to hate others
