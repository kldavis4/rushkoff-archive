was one of my cousin's best friends ...

think the problem is that people

o. tand pohtlCS as this once· und\~our-years consumer choicee\~er American Idol idea of voting t is he one you like. And while it's

(\~\~rtant. it's no substitute for civic

engagement.

_

I think people have lost uack of c1v1cs. Civics happens

ve locally in

_

a bottom-up way, and

th\~needs of different communities

\~rcolate up to the national leaders

through local action. I think it's important to keep track of both, but I think people spend too much energy

on then presidential candidates . because that's the set bid-your kmd of coke or Pepsi, McDonald's or Burker

King . At this point, I pretty much know

rrn going to vote for whoever's not

rrump. Now that I know that, if I look at the Democratic candidates

and am asked which one I'd like to

influence, Elizabeth Warren seems

to have a whole lot of substance that

most of the others don't. There's a few

that look interesting-and because I

am who I am, I'm trying to help give the right language to some of these democratic candidates about how to

get past the socialism label and start looking at: how do you predistrib

ute

the means of production rat

her than

redistribute the spoils of capitalism. It's not about taxing people after the fact or giving

UBI \[universal basic income\]. it's abo

ut who owns

wh

at, and who owns these factories and

these towns,

and

distrib

ute that

ownership. I want to help give them the nght langua

ge. How

do you move from a growt

h-based economy to a

flow-based eco

nomy?,_. Beyond that. I spend most of

my poh\\1cal energy locally, and I think thats where

people can really make

a difference. It's really easy to hate others

when

you're talking about 1deolog1es that

have noth111g to do with you. It's·a lot harder to hate people whenJou're workrng together
