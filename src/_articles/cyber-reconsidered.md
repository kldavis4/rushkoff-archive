Doug Rushkoff is the author of eight popular books about digital and pop culture, including _Media Virus,_ and _Coercion: Why We Listen to What "They" Say._ His 1995 book, _Cyberia: Life in the Trenches of Hyperspace_ focused on the cyberculture movement of the early 1990s. I was one of the book's subjects. In this conversation, we looked back, and then discussed the State of the Cyberculture circa 2001. Rushkoff added additional comments after the events of 9/11. _-RU_

**R.U. SIRIUS:** _Your first major book was **Cyberia**. Do you feel like you were led down a blind alley by the psychedelic cyberculture of the '90s?_

**DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF:** Not at all. Although I do believe that the psychedelic cyberculture of the early '90s was led down a blind alley by the market pushers of the late '90s.

We have to make a clear distinction between three very different elements: the counterculture, the cyber-renaissance, and the e-market pyramid. The counterculture has been around since culture. Pro-mutational forces have always been pushing civilization towards new forms of experience and expression. They certainly found a powerful tool in the personal computer and networking, and saw in these devices a way to develop and extend their mission.

The easiest way to understand the synergy between the psychedelic culture and computers is to remember that, back in the late '80s, there were very few people equipped to imagine the possibilities of a designer realm such as cyberspace. The people developing software and interfaces were being called upon to construct a hallucinatory landscape that didn't exist before. They were dreaming up worlds that would then exist. At that time, who already had enough experience in hallucinatory, designer-reality to work there professionally and with purpose? Psychedelics users, of course.

So the tradition of hiring Deadheads and members of other psychedelic subcultures as Silicon Valley programmers has very practical roots. It also had very broad repercussions.

Renaissances are moments when a culture experiences a dramatic shift in perspective. The original renaissance involved perspective painting, circumnavigating a formerly flat globe, the introduction of coffee from Morocco (actually closer to the Enlightenment), calculus, and the printing press. The new renaissance brings us the next set of dimensional leaps in the form of the holograph and fractal, the atomic bomb, the discovery of LSD, chaos math, and the Internet. Each of these innovations allows us to shift our perspective on reality -- we shift up a dimensional level, and become more aware of the relationships between dimensions.

It is during these shifts that everything is up for grabs. A shift of this magnitude creates a gap in the ability of our language to describe our reality of our perceptions. During the shift, we negotiate what the next world will look like. In this way, a renaissance leads to a battle between different forces and worldviews to define the next culture. And we do all this quite quickly, because there's only a brief period when so much of reality is up for grabs-- before it gets locked down again.

The cyberdelic culture believed it could use the Internet and other computer technologies to commandeer the renaissance. We were going to make the world in our own image, for a change. It seemed that anyone turning on to the Internet may as well have been turning on to mushrooms. Going online fundamentally changed the user's experience of the world. People started believing in the Gaia hypothesis and the interconnectedness of all living things.

But in a variety of ways, the deconstructed, demystified, do-it-yourself ethic of the early cyberdelic era was undone. People were just having too much fun, and our online activities were having a powerful impact on our relationship to traditional media programming. We started watching less TV, and became less susceptible to television programming like advertising. (This was what GenX originally referred to.)

These effects of the computer revolution had to be undone. So online specialists from the world of _Wired_ came up with ways to mitigate the liberating potential of new technologies. They invented concepts like stickyness and eyeball hours, in order to regain control over a culture threatening full-scale renaissance. They turned the Internet as best they could into a strip mall or tv dial, and worked to limit our partipation through the keyboard to the entering of a credit card number.

Meanwhile, counterculture programmers who spent years arguing against cynicism about the emergence of a technoculture were finally being rewarded--with jobs and cash. To them, it didn't seem so terrible at all to create a web site for AT&T or any other corporate conglomerate. It meant that the elders were finally recognizing the inevitably of our interactive culture. And it did.

But it was a case of Pink Floyd's "Welcome to the Machine." A bad one, that rivals even rock 'n roll's co-option by the market. Luckily, the scenario plan devised by the various strategic business networks failed, and the imposition of market ideology over the Internet just didn't work. But it took down a lot of well-meaning people with it.

That's what my new novel is about, really. The way people get enslaved by ideas and stories that aren't real. They are tempting--just as tempting as a house in Redwood Hills--but they are booby prizes, and keep us from touching the genuine power we may have tapped.

So, no. I don't feel I was led astray by the cyberdelic community. Not in the least. But I do feel sad, having witnessed their temptation, distraction, and enslavement. Like the Bible teaches, people who build pyramids--whether they're made of stone or investments--are slaves.

**(Added after 9/11)**  
What the cyberculture experienced was a liberation from a certain narrative. It felt something like liberation from narrative itself. Renaissance events allow for people to rise above the story. Sure, they get trapped in a new one, but that moment of shifting realities from story to meta-story, or game to meta-game, is really special. Quite valuable, really, because it permits us to remember that none of the stories are real. They're templates, superimposed on our reality.

At the very least, we become co-creators of subsequent narratives. I have nothing against narratives, as long as we are all allowed to write them.

The replacement of cyberculture with the dot.com pyramid was an attempt to impose a narrative on the choose-your-own-adventure, open-endedness of cyberculture. The Internet, if you remember, was not seen by big business as an opportunity, but as a threat. The object of the game was to neutralize the threat. Sure, a lot of people thought they were going to make a lot of money using the Internet word in their business plans. But the real, lasting function of the speculative economic game was to recontextualize the cyber-renaissance in a business narrative. It didn't work, because the businesses failed, and not everyone abandoned interactive telecommunications. We're still writing the story.

The terrorist attacks on the WTC and Pentagon were another attempt to arrest self-determination with a static narrative. That's why Falwell couldn't help but justify them. Fundamentalists are people committed to narrative. Instead of changing their narratives to conform to the consensus, they attempt to change the world to fit their obsolete narratives. The narrative is fixed.

Their narrative (Falwell's and radical so-called Islam) is Armageddon. The world was getting too tolerant, too networked, and too empowered. What the cyber-renaissance taught us is that the story isn't written. It emerges, just as organization emerges from a system. The imposition of a narrative structure, in most cases, will simply impede the emergence of genuine systemic balance. (No, this is not an argument for libertarianism. It is a call for the conscious co-creation, the crafted evolution of an open-ended human story.)

**RU:** _In terms of cyber-counterculture, didn't those attitudes spread at the same time as the great NASDAQ/dot-com hype did, as manifested by Linux and Napster and Gnutella and Slashdot and so forth? Perhaps the end of the '90s was just so much at once, that we couldn't see our own growth through the haze..._

**DR:** Well, of course, it was all happening simultaneously. In many ways, the corporate attack on Internet culture only strengthened us. People like me naively believed that the cyber-renaissance was quite inevitable. We had successfully wrested the Internet from the government's hands, and believed we had enacted a kind of power to the people.

Little did we realize that our rejection of government would simply give free reign to corporations. It's like when you take antibiotics to kill off bacteria--you forget that you create terrific conditions for fungus to grow. Well, corporations were that fungus, that spread unchecked throughout the networks.

Over the past year, however, the Internet--like a living system--rejected the fungal attack. Now, it's stronger than ever. Like an organism that has fought off a virus, we have come to recognize it. We understand the structure and tactics of corporations, we understand that they are not really alive at all, but pieces of code.

And this sensibility is trickling down to 'mass' culture in the form of Naomi Klein's _No Logo,_ my _Coercion_ or Frontline documentary, _Adbusters,_ï»¿ and more.

True enough, there was a real Internet culture developing the whole time. It wasn't really a Dark Ages at all--even though the _New York Times_ couldn't seem to cover anything about the Internet that didn't involve the NASDAQ index. It's really the public perception of the Internet that was changed--from that of a telecommunications infrastructure to a market phenomenon. People began to think of the Internet as a speculative opportunity rather than a cultural or, dare we say, spiritual one.

The crash of the dot.com market needs to be distinguished from the life cycle of the Internet. What happened on NASDAQ has very little to do with Internet culture--except for the fact that a lot of the companies suffering now were responsible directly and indirectly for building the bandwidth that we're using to have all this fun right now. I'm writing to you from a cybercafe in London, in fact. At frighteningly fast T3 speeds. Can't imagine this would have happened without a huge cash influx from hapless investors.

So now, we're getting to play on the roads left behind by would-be emperors. Fine with me.

And yes, of course, great things like Blogger and Gnutella have been developing all along. Honestly, I feel like the major innovations all occurred in the shareware community before 1995, when Netscape went public. I certainly have a hard time thinking of any real innovation that came through the free market capitalist development paradigm. Explorer, streaming video, Outlook, are all just dolled up versions of programs that came out of University Illinois at Champagne Urbana (Mozilla), or Cornell (CUSeeMe), or MIT.

Slashdot was terrific throughout the dark time, of course. Odd, though, that the culture of programmers became something of a counter-culture online, though, eh? These were the people building the whole thing--and they were relegated to a kind of underground status.

I've just written an article for the _Guardian_ encouraging programmers to create a Global Union. Now that'd put some power back where it belongs. And it could allow programmers to act as the final human safety valve between corporations and the technologies they're using to embody themselves.

**RU:** _We appeared together on a panel discussion at the SF Film Festival a few moons back for Iara Lee's film, **Synthetic Pleasures**. We were discussing radical technological developments and you advocated "pedal to the metal." I was actually ever-so-slightly more conservative about it. Then a few years later, you signed on with the Technorealists, and with the publication of **Coercion**, you were hyped as the guy who used to be one of the technophiles who has become a nay-saying critic. I know the reality is more ambiguous and complex, and figured that you've got to serve it up in simple black and white to the media--particularly in press releases. Could you comment on this?_

_Relatedly, while I joined the chorus of critics of the whole **Wired** cyberlibertarian juggernaut, I remained an unreconstructed technophile. I still think that any possibility of improving the human situation for a complicated six billion person strong world lies in using technology to eliminate scarcity and psychological damage. Neither one-by-one spiritual self-development nor political activism is going to make more than the slightest dent. Your thoughts on this one too, please._

**DR:** Things do change, you know? I probably would have backed the French Revolution, too--right up until about the time they started chopping off heads. My grandmother was a pretty committed communist until she found out what was going on over in Stalin's Russia. Doesn't change the validity of Marx's ideas, though - just their execution.

Honestly, though, the "pedal to the metal" I was advocating was the cyberpunk consciousness, autonomous thinking, cross-cultural networking and designer reality--or what I'm now calling Open Source Reality--that seemed to be the inevitable result of playing with these new technologies. Everyone who went online between '88 and, say, '95 seemed to have the same response: a full-on reconsideration of the relationship of the individual to the rest of civilization, and a radical reappraisal of the functioning of the collective human organism. It seemed to me as if all the careful consideration and vigilant analysis of the effects of technology on human potential would only slow the renaissance--perhaps to the point where it could be stopped or overturned by those who were threatened by it.

As I experienced it at the time, the cultural renaissance of the mid-'90s was akin to the creation of a turbulent system. The linear, top-down mediaspace of the past, as well as the highly controlled and unidirectional flow of information and cultural programming, was giving way. The more faxes, cameras, internet connections, and literacy we could muster, the more multi-directional, human-generated, and chaotic the mediaspace would become.

Thanks to turbulence (and I mean the kind we see in wave systems and clouds, not violent riots) the linear culture of the past centuries was finally giving way. But it was fighting back. It seemed to me that anything but a pedal-to-the-metal tactic would give them time to regroup and reorganize a counterattack.

And, of course, that's exactly what happened. A totally misinformed _Time_ magazine cover story about cyberporn, coupled with shock tactics about "internet bombs" and attention deficit disorder from the rest of mainstream media, kept people at arms-length from a new medium that they feared would hurt them and their children in some unpredictable way. When they did go online, it was through the sanitized portals of AOL or some other commercial service, and by the time they got themselves all the way through to the world wide web (which AOL didn't offer for a good long time) they were greeted by the e-commerce merchants, who had time to set up shop.

The thing I didn't realize back in the early '90s was that our hatred of government intervention online, and our successful elimination of most government influence over cyberspace had the unintended side-effect of giving free reign to business. So pedal-to-the-metal ended up meaning much more than "get rid of all restrictions." It meant "let the (so-called) free market libertarians run wild." And, though we don't have time for a full-on discussion of economics, here, the business practices, alliances, and misrepresentations made by the venture capitalists of silicon alley and valley do not represent a free market at all.

But by the late '90s, the Internet had been recast as a business plan, and open universal access meant international 'open' markets. As the original Long Boom propagandists insisted "open good, closed bad: tattoo it on your forehead." So pedal-to-the-metal meant running with this lunacy. Too bad.

I'm still as impatient as ever for cultural evolution to take place, for human beings to use whatever technologies (from language to love-making) are at their disposal to network politically and develop compassion, and for the demystification of the mass media to change the relationship of the disenfranchised to their cultural programming. I'm still quite enthusiastic about technology and human potential. I simply understand that the market is much more powerful than I had imagined, and that it feeds off fear and unconsciousness.

As for your second part, true. Still, spiritual development and political activism are important stages in an individual and a society's growth. I mean, I always talk about the remote control allowing for deconstruction, the joystick demystifying the image, and then the keyboard allowing for DIY culture to be born. What
