Doug Rushkoff is the author of eight popular books about digital and pop culture, including _Media Virus,_ and _Coercion: Why We Listen to What "They" Say._ His 1995 book, _Cyberia: Life in the Trenches of Hyperspace_ focused on the cyberculture movement of the early 1990s. I was one of the book's subjects. In this conversation, we looked back, and then discussed the State of the Cyberculture circa 2001. Rushkoff added additional comments after the events of 9/11. _-RU_

**R.U. SIRIUS:** _Your first major book was **Cyberia**. Do you feel like you were led down a blind alley by the psychedelic cyberculture of the '90s?_

**DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF:** Not at all. Although I do believe that the psychedelic cyberculture of the early '90s was led down a blind alley by the market pushers of the late '90s.
