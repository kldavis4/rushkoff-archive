**HACKING BORDERS:  
REVOLUTION OR RENAISSANCE?**

So often we hear people using the word _revolution_ to describe the current overwhelming cultural shift fostered by technology and new media. However overwhelming it might be, can we really describe the current transition as a revolution? For me, the word _revolution_ evokes images of a violent upheaval and guillotined heads. There's certainly very little progress implied by _revolution_; it is simply someone spinning around in circles. Digital culture may be marginally revolutionary in the sense that it is characterized by what so many companies and institutions have called "thinking outside the box"--a willingness to challenge conventions and consider meta-narratives. But this notion of thinking outside the box and gaining perspective is not simply moving in a circle. We are coming to a new understanding of what had always been considered literal reality; we are seeing it instead as a picture of reality. Our new tools are also leading us to feel empowered enough to adjust the frame around that picture. Such an upscaling of perception, intention, and design is better described as _renaissance_.

_Renaissance_ literally means "rebirth." Old ideas emerge in a new context. A renaissance is a reconfiguring of the constructed ways we experience the world in order to reconnect with it, the adaptation our cultural lenses to conform to our changing vision. In the last Renaissance, a number of discoveries and inventions changed our most basic experience of the real. Perspective painting allowed us to create representations of reality that simulated dimensionality. The discovery that the world was round and the ability to circumnavigate it radically redefined our notion of space and our sense of agency. The development of calculus allowed us to relate planes to spheres and spheres to four-dimensional fictional objects, performing conceptual calculations never before possible. The printing press allowed the widespread distribution of ideas and data, connecting people in expanded social and political communities. By the Enlightenment, coffee imported from Morocco encouraged people to stay up late at night and talk, giving rise to a "bohemian" culture dedicated to challenging conventional models of reality through the new perspectives they had gained.

The late 20th century brought discoveries and inventions whose collective impact could be considered a renaissance of at least equal magnitude. While perspective painting allowed Renaissance artists to create two-dimensional images, the holograph now allows us to create three-dimensional representations that approximate our vision even more closely. By manipulating the laws of perspective, some Renaissance painters created deliberately skewed or "trick" representations of reality, challenging the reliability of our vision and suggesting the possibility that illusion exists in reality. The mechanics of the holograph offer a similar challenge because when a holographic plate is shattered into many pieces, the image is not fragmented. Each shard of the plate will contain a smaller image of the entire original, suggesting that fractal relationships may underlie much of our illusions as well as our reality. The underlying technology of holographs further extends our understanding of dimensionality and has been used to understand everything from society to brain anatomy.

Although Renaissance explorers discovered that the world was round, modern scientists discovered atomic energy and took us to the moon. Having already mastered the globe through exploration, we were now able to explore beyond it, to see it as an object from another position in space, and even to destroy it. Meanwhile, chaos math and systems theory opened complex conceptual possibilities in much the same way calculus had for Renaissance mathematicians.

and the Internet have changed communication, publication, and

the idea of community to a degree comparable to the printing press. LSD and psychedelics, like the coffee beans of the Renaissance, had people staying up late

together and experimenting with the status quo.

A renaissance is a shift in perspective, the shift from living within a model to

moving outside of it. Or, as video gamers might express it, from game to metagame. Young people who spend a lot of time immersed

ments understand this phenomenon

in video game environwell. There are two ways one can learn to

play a game. The first is to read the rules, practice, and use old-fashioned trial and

error. The second is to find the magazines and Web sites that will share secret

codes to avoid traps, win levels, and gain special advantages in the game. Are the

people using these "cheat sheets" really playing the game? Certainly, but the g

society. It is akin to the realization we have in the heightened state of awareness

caused by a mystical or psychedelic experience: At the height of\~ vi\~ionquest we

wonder how we will be able to remember that state of awe or 1ns1ght once the

experience is over. We wonder how to plant a seed or land\~ark of some kind that

It was a perplexing question. A zipper is a medium; open, it means one thing and closed, another. A face is a medium; we read people's appearance and expressions for information about them. Even our DNA is a medium-arguably, the best medium nature has developed, capable of sending codes through the millennia. Ultimately, only a person's most essential consciousness--one's agency, will, and intention-isn't a medium.

LET THERE BE NETWORKS

I saw a bumper sticker on a minivan in Wisconsin recently that read, "In case of

rapture, this car will be empty!" I suppose that little quip means my car will still

be occupied. But I am less troubled by the inevitability of my damnation, accord-

ing to their schema, than the delight with which those Milwaukee passengers were

anticipating Armageddon. They are looking forward to the apocalypse!

This is what happens when people take the stories their religions offer a bit too

literally. Sure enough, the narratives of the Bible-like those of many other reli-

gi\~ns-tell a version of the history of the human race, from God's creation of \~e

uruverse thr\~ugh the life and death of a messiah right on to the end of everything

and the tallymg of the score. If you subscribe to the right story and follow the

rules, all you have to do is wait for the ending and you'll be saved. Best of all, the

£real quandaries of human existence-questions such as "Where do we come rom \~" and "Wh d d · d fare.

EXPLORATIONS IN MEDIA ECOLOGY

This was the sad fate of poor infidels like me, until pretty recently. Thanks to

the Internet, we now have a way out of the story: We can write our own endings.

After all, this interactive medium is, at its core, an invitation to talk back-tele-

vision with a keyboard. The online world is one in which we are entitled to voice

our own opinions, however much they might contradict the status quo. We are

challenged to reflect on the stories we're being told, even create our own ver-

sions--our own, personal, sacred truths.

What a terrific weapon the Internet gives us against extreme fundamentalism!

And it comes just in time now that we're facing the darkest terror of true believ-

ers who blindly follow the unilateral decrees of their leaders. For fundamentalists

are simply people who insist that their religion's narrative become everyone else's

literal truth.

Interactive media tend to loosen up those fixed narratives by allowing users to

contribute their own ideas to the story. Try giving a sermon in an AOL chat room,

or a list of commandments on the Yahoo Internet Life bulletin boards. The peo-

ple you're preaching to won't remain silent, at all. The clergy I know who have

taken their messages online have had to reassess their roles as ministers of faith and

accept new ones as partners in spiritual learning. When religion is practiced on the

Internet, participants quickly realize that we're all in this together.

The Internet undermines the blind obedience of fundamentalism by offering

alternative points of view, promoting pluralism, and encouraging feedback. Not

that this interactivity is all that new. While the fundamentalist priests of ancient

Israel sacrificed animals on the altar, those interested in hypertext were sitting

around a table arguing together as they wrote the Talmud. While fundamentalist

lslamists were declaring their first Holy Wars, liberals in old Baghdad were shar-

ing wine and finding common ground with similarly inclined Christians and Jews.

Today, the Internet deconstructs the narratives that religions use to explain the

world, while inviting people from every race and culture to participate in the con-

..

\- - \~.-ion. No wonder fundamentalists are getting upset .

room. And Jobs, a Buddhist at the time, didn't call it an Apple for nothing. The personal computer was the forbidden fruit-a way of access to the Tree of

Knowledge, and an affront to those who would sequester any information from the formerly little people. The meek would indeed inherit the earth.

The realms of computing and, even more so, networking were unfamiliar turf.

They were hard to navigate and harder still to design. People were creating a uni-

verse now, and it was as challenging as a lucid dream: Anything we could imagine,

we would behold. It's no wonder that many Silicon Valley firms were forced to rely on the skills of many wild young members of the counterculture, people whose own mystical excursions had brought th\~m into i\~timate contact with real- ities as mutable and hallucinatory as any graphical user interface.

THE END OF THE OLD STORY

Interactivity changed our relationship to other media, too. It was hard to watch

telcl\\'ision in quite the same way, especially with a remote control in your hand.

Whether we simply channel-surfed away from the surfers on Baywatch, or went

online and posted alternatives to a

CNN story, our interactive tools gave us the

ability to

deconstruct the stories we were being told, and to begin to construct our

own.

Thi.-, s i actually somc.>thing very rare, especially in the spiritual realm.

There are a few faiths in which congrcgants arc invited to participate in the cre-

ation and interpretation of the underlying narrative. Certain Jewish sects spurn

answers in favor

of more questions and interpretation; Quakers enjoy a dogma-

frce, town-mcc.-ting style Sabbath. Most religious traditions, however, simply treat

their believers as a "mass," who must depend on their priests or ministers for

access to the "story." But just as the internet has led patients to information about

alternative medical treatments (often against doctor's orders), it has given congre-

gants the ability to find alternative stories about who we are, who made us, and

why.

More important than any one story we may have discovered or written, the

experience of sifting through them all, taking them apart, and writing our own has

changed our relationship to religion, perhaps forever. The Internet is anathema to

narrative. If you want to understand life as a story etched in stone, you had better

stay away.

The television remote control represented the first in a series of liberating inter-

active technologies. Imagine a man sitting in his LaZBoy chair in 1958, with pop-

corn on his lap, watching a painful commercial. The TV programmer is dead-set

on throwing this poor man into a terrible state of anxiety. If the viewer wants to

get out of that imposed state of tension, he's got to move the popcorn off his lap,

lift himself out of his chair, walk up to the TV, and turn the channel-which is,

perhaps, 50 calories of human labor. If he sits through to the end of the commer-

cial, however, he may use up only 10 calories of anxiety. The brain is lazy; it makes

the lazy decision. It will take the 10 calories and submit to the programming. After

all, the material on TV is called programming for a reason; it's designed to pro-

gram us as we sit passively in our seat. But the remote control changes the equa-

cion, Imagine a 14-year-old today, watching a commercial, and feeling the first

signs that he's being put into an imposed state of tension. With the .0001 calorie

that it takes to press a button, he's out of tension and out of the arc of that story.

Kids with a remote control watch TV in a new way, following 10 stations at once,

surfing back and forth through different stories. When they experience TV like

this they' re not watching television at all, but watching the television, decon-

structing it as television.

The second liberating interactive device was the videogame joystick. For most

of you, your inaugurating videogame experience was Pong. And, perhaps amaz-

ingly, you probably still remember that first moment you played. Pong was a sim-

ple game based on ping-pong, with two white squares on either side of the screen

that would move up and down along with your movements on a control knob.

People remember their first time playing Pong the way they remember where

they were when President Kennedy was shot. This isn't because Americans loved

table tennis so much and were happy to have the convenience of practicing it on

TY. It wasn't about the literal meaning of the metaphor; it was about experiencing

something on the television as metaphor. It was a thrill just to move the little white

square up and down on the screen, to control the pixel. We had never had control

of the pixel before. The TV screen was the holy and inaccessible realm of news-

casters and movie stars, a magical place where things simply appeared. But just as

the remote control deconstructed television's stories, so the joystick demystified

its technology-making it an accessible medium and rendering it safe.

Finally, the computer mouse and the keyboard liberated the receive-only mon-

itor, and turned it into a portal through which we could express ourselves. The

mouse and keyboard spawned a do-it-yourself (DIY) Internet culture in which

people created, uploaded, and shared their own content. In a sense, people were

the content; we used technology to connect with other people.

The resulting cyberpunk culture was a renaissance culture. It was a chaotic

space, where new ideas could spring up from almost anywhere. It was a gift econ-

omy, where new programs were created and shared-for free. It was a communi-

ty, where new members were introduced and escorted around as if they had just

bought a home in a fantasy suburb. Best of all, Internet users came to understand

that the mainstream mediaspace no longer represented their reality. From now on,

Internet users would represent their own.

In those days-the 2400-baud, ASCII-text era of ten long years ago-the

Internet had nothing to do with the NASDAQ index. In fact, until 1992 you had

to sign an agreement promising not to conduct any business online just to get

access to the Internet! Imagine that. It was a business-free zone.

How could such rules have ever been put in place? Because the Internet began

as a public project. It was created to allow scientists at universities and government

facilities to share research and computing resources. Everyone from the Pentagon

to Al Gore saw the value of universally accessible information-sharing network,

47

• Paglia : The North American Intellectual Tradition

and invested all sorts of federal funds in building a backbone capable of connect- ing computers around the world.

What they didn't realize was that they were doing a whole lot more than con- necting computers to one another. They were connecting people to one another, too. Before long, all those scientists who were supposed to be exchanging research or comparing data were also exchanging stories about their families and compar- ing notes on the latest Star Trek movies. People from around the world were play- ing games, socializing, and crossing cultural boundaries that had never been crossed before. Because no one was using it to discuss military technology any- more, the government abandoned the network and turned it over to the public. The Internet's unexpected social side-effect turned out to be its incontrovertible main feature. Its other functions fall by the wayside. The Internet's ability to net- work human beings is its very life's blood. It fosters communication, collabora- tion, sharing, helpfulness, and community. Then word got out. The nerdiest among us found out first. Then came those of us whose friends were nerds. Then their friends, and so on. Someone would simply insist he had found something you needed to know about-the way a childhood friend lets you in on a secret door leading down to the basement under the junior high school.

How many of you can remember that first time you watched him log on? How he turned the keyboard over to you and asked what you want to know, where you want to visit, or whom you want to meet? That was the magic moment when you "got it." Internet fever. There was a whole new world out there, unlimited by the constraints of time and space, appearance and prejudice, gender and power.

It's no wonder so many people compared the 1990s Internet to the psychedelic

1960s. It seemed that all we needed to do was get a person online and he or she

would be changed forever. And people were. A sixty-year-old midwestern busi-

nessman I know found himself logging on every night to engage in a conversation

about Jungian archetypes. It lasted for four weeks before he even realized the per-

son with whom he was conversing was a sixteen-year-old boy from Tokyo.

It felt as though we were wiring up a global brain. Visionaries of the period, like

Ted Nelson, invented words like hypertext and told us how the Internet could be

used as a library for everything ever written. A musician named Jaron Lanier

invented a bizarre interactive space he called "virtual reality," in which people

would be able to, in his words, "really see what the other means." Starry-eyed

authors like me wrote optimistic books announcing the new global renaissance.

The Internet was no longer a government research project. It was alive. Out of

control and delightfully chaotic. What's more, it promoted an agenda all its own.

Using a computer mouse and keyboard to access other human beings on the

other side of the monitor changed our relationship to media and the power they

held. The tube was no longer a place that only a corporate conglomerate could

access. It was Rupert Murdoch, Dan Rather, and Heather Locklear's turf no more.

The Internet was our space.

Internet connection. It was considered an honor to rush out into the night to fix

a fellow us ' hni 1 er s tee ca problem. To be an Internet user was to be an Internet

advocate.

It's also why almost everything to do with the Internet was free. Software was

designed by people who wanted to make the Internet a better place. Hackers

stayed up late making new programs and then distributed them free of charge to

anyone who cared to use them.

All the programs we use today are actually based on this shareware and free-

ware. Internet Explorer and Netscape are just fat versions of a program called

Mosaic, created at the University of Illinois. Streaming media technology is really

just dolled up version of CUSeeM e, a program developed at Cornell. The Internet

was built for love, not profit.

And that was the problem-for business, anyway. At the time almost no one

Anct that was the problem-for business, anyway. At the time almost no one

to be undone. As more and more people got online, they spent less and less time

c\~nsuming television programs and commercials. Studies showed that families

with Internet connections were watching 3 or 4 hours less TV a week, seeing

fewer commercials, and buying fewer TV-advertised products. Furthermore, peo-

ple who_ are having fun and feeling connected to other people are less easily

coerced into purchases. Something had to be done.

WHOSE STORY IS IT, ANYWAY?

Thus began the long march to turn the Internet into a profitable enterprise. It

started with content. Dozens, then hundreds of online magazines sprang up. But

because the Internet had always been free, no one wanted to pay a subscription

charge for content. It just wasn't something one did online. So most of the maga-

zines went out of business.

The others, well, they invented the next great Internet catastrophe: the banner

ad. Web publishers figured they could sell a little strip on top of each web page to

an advertiser, who'd use it as a billboard for commercials. But everyone hated

them. They got in the way. It was like scuba diving with someone putting bumper

stickers over your mask. And the better we got at ignoring banner ads, the more

distractingly busy they grew and the more time-consuming they were to down-

load. They only taught us to resent whichever advertiser was inhibiting our

movement.

R us h k O ff: R e n a is s a n c e No w I

So advertising gave way to e-commerce. First, the mediaspace deconstructed by

the remote control had to be put back together. People doing what comes natu-

rally online, like typing messages to one another, don't generate revenue. The

object of the game, for Internet business, was to get people's hands off the key-

board and onto the mouse. Less collaboration, more consumption. Companies

developed concepts such as stickiness, attention economy, and eyeball hours in an

effort to keep people glued to Web sites as they were once glued to TV stations.

In response to panicked articles from the mainstream media about a channel-surf-

ing culture and decreasing attention spans, attention deficit disorder diagnoses and

Ritalin prescriptions rose over 100%. Children's ability to enact renaissance was

curtailed through drugs.

In order to regain control of the pixel, which the joystick had liberated, pro-

fessional designers re-mystified the computer's interface so that it was no longer

two-way. Users were forced to rely on the "wizards" built into their software pro-

grams to work magic they didn't understand. Consider the increasing opacity of

the interlace from DOS to the Macintosh to Windows2000. Look at the colorful

and confusing interfaces used on the World Wide Web compared with the text-

only bulletin boards of the early Internet. And "information architecture" turned

into the science of getting people to click on the "buy" button. The only way to

participate on the Web is through the mouse; the only opportunity to use the key-

board is to enter one's credit card information (if it's not already on a cookie,

somewhere deep on our hard drive). The increasing and deliberate opacity of new

interfaces is designed to keep us out.

Finally, in order to undo the DIY culture that had grown out of the keyboard

and the mouse, commerce replaced community and content replaced people as the

soul of the Net. It was announced that we were in an "Information Age" rather

than a "Communication Age" because information can be bought and sold as a

commodity.

Anyone logging onto the Internet for the first time in the year 2000 encountered

a very different Internet than the interactive playground of ten years earlier.

Browsers and search engines alike were designed to keep users either buying

products or consuming commercial conte\~t. Most of thosr ____ ackers were

now vested employees of dot.com companies. And most '

In the interests of the investment community, the Internet was resty e as an

online mall. A direct marketing platform. An interactive ma\~-or\~er catalog! This

little scheme seemed to hold more promise. So much prormse, m fact, that Wall

Street investors took notice. Not that many of these e-commerce businesses actu-

ally made money. But they looked like someday they could.

Besides, Wall Street cares less about actual revenues than the ability to create the

perception that there might be revenues at some point in the future. That's why it's

called speculation. Others might call it a pyramid scheme. Here's how it works:

bigger business plan and hire a CEO. Then comes the "first round" and "second

round," where other, slightly less in-the-know people invest a few million more.

Then come the institutional investors who underwrite the now-infamous Initial

\~ri\~ Offering (IPO) on NASDAQ. This final ground level is called "going pub-

lic., At the very bottom of the pyramid, come retail investors. That's you and me.

We re supposed to log into an e-trading site and invest our money. So what's all

that got to do with the Internet, you ask? Exactly. The Internet was merely the

sexy word, the come-hither, the bright idea at the top of the pyramid. Sure, there

were and are still plenty of entrepreneurs creating vibrant, successful online busi-

nesses-look at Yahoo, Amazon, and Ebay. But the Internet wasn't born to sup-

port the kind of global economic boom that venture capitalists were envisioning.

And by turning the Internet's principle use from socializing toward monetizing,

business went against the Internet's very functionality.

No longer able to deconstruct, demystify, or develop our own media, we suc-

cumbed to an entirely new story about the promise new media: money. Of course,

by the time the general public was buying shares online, the people at the top of

the pyramid disappeared-taking away their money as the pyramid collap\~ed

beneath them in what is called an "exit strategy." That's another way of saymg

"carpet bag."

bigger business plan and hire a CEO. Then comes the "first round" and "second

round," where other, slightly less in-the-know people invest a few million more.

Then come the institutional investors who underwrite the now-infamous Initial

\~rice Offering (IPO) on NASDAQ. This final ground level is called "going pub-

lic.•: At the very bottom of the pyramid, come retail investors. That's you and me.

We re supposed to log into an e-trading site and invest our money. So what's all

that got to do with the Internet, you ask? Exactly. The Internet was merely the

sexy word, the come-hither, the bright idea at the top of the pyramid. Sure, there

were and are still plenty of entrepreneurs creating vibrant, successful online busi-

nesses-look at Yahoo, Amazon, and Ebay. But the Internet wasn't born to sup-

pon the kind of global economic boom that venture capitalists were envisioning.

An\~ by turning the Internet's principle use from socializing toward monetizing,

busmess went against the Internet's very functionality.

No longer able to deconstruct, demystify, or develop our own media, we suc-

cumbed to an entirely new story about the promise new media: money. Of course,

by the time the general public was buying shares online, the people at the top of

the pyramid disappeared-taking away their money as the pyramid collapsed

beneath them in what is called an "exit strategy." That's another way of saying

"carpet bag."

eventually run out of money. The dot.com collapse was also aided, in part, by the

Internet's o\~n s\~ructure and function. Its organic and interactive make-up shrugs

off interventionist government controls. Just a bit more effort halted the corpo-

rate attacks that followed. It's no different than when the government abandoned

the Internet in the 1980s. Instead of talking about defense contracts, the scientists

online began talking about science fiction stories. The Internet never does what it's

supposed to do. It has a mind, and life, of its own. .

Now that the dot.com pyramid has failed to establish itself as the overarching

metaphor of the Digital Age, digital reality-and perhaps our social reality-is

once again up for grabs. That's because we're alive, too.

Rushkoff: Renaissance Now!

The many great \~pplications that real people and organizations have developed

to make all of our lives better are taking center stage. They are compelling and sur-

pas\~ even so\~e of our wildest dreams for what the Internet might someday

achieve. The ideas, information, and applications now launching on Web sites

around the world capitalize on the transparency, usability, and accessibility that

the Internet was born to deliver.

As long as we can maintain our renaissance sensibility and our awareness of the

implications of the open source reality in which we live, we have access to enor-

mous opportunities for cultural progress. These opportunities imply profound

consequences for any of us who have become conscious of how to hack the bor-

ders of reality.

People who have been exposed to the Internet and to other interactive and vir-

tual systems understand that our world-any system-is made up of intentional-

ly designed interfaces. Spending so much time in virtual space, we are more aware

of real space, political space, and ideological space, and the way it shapes interac-

tion. We are more sensitive to the power and the way it is exploited. Right now,

as a result of our renaissance sensibility, the definitions and conventions of our

reality are becoming the component parts of a new language. Nothing is only

itself, because its identifying characteristics become a self-conscious manifestation

of its underlying essence. An ironic distance. A self-conscious reframing of almost

everything.

Renaissance awareness is a form of self-protection, really. A defense. We are try-

ing to focus on the mediated feeling of things. We want to stay awake in renais-

sance awareness as long as possible before the next reality template concretizes

itself and self-conscious similes become tight metaphors. We now see that this is

like that, sort of like that-it is as if. But we know that eventually "it is like" and

"it is as if" will collapse into "it is . " The world is that. Reality's transparency and

accessibility lost yet again. At the same time, however, there is great longing to let

go, t\~ trust t?at the world is not trying to do something to us-to engage in an

experience without fear and suspicion. Artists and writers have been working on

this problem for centuries. Shakespeare often wrote es for ' ·

this problem for centuries. Shakespeare often wrote prologues for his plays in

which a character lets the audience in on the metaphor: "oh pardon gentles all, that

we would presume that the stage would represent ... " The modesty and honesty

give your audience permission to relax. They know they are not going to be

manipulated. If we can communicate this sort of goodwill in ritualized contexts,

we should be able to do it in the real world of communication, as well.

It is the responsibility of programmers and designers, in particular, to realize

that genuine social engagement and genuine discourse are what will keep people

out of the traps and trances they are now at pains to avoid. If we can create online

and mediated experiences that foster this kind of interaction and discourse-expe-

riences that facilitate people as people, rather than subjugating them to other

intentions-we will prolong our sense of freedom as well as our ability to hack

even more of world's imaginary borders.

EXPLORATIONS IN MEDIA ECOLOGY

RENAISSANCE NOW

To thos_e of us who really love it, the Internet is looking and feeling more social

more \~ive, more _participatory, and more, well, "Internety" than ever before. No;

s\~umping or w\~rung, slowing up or winding down. This might sound surprising,

given ?1e headlmes on most newspapers' business pages these days, which have

procl\~med the technology bubble officially burst. Likewise, analysts on the

financial cable channels and the venture capitalists of Silicon Alley now shun any

company whose name ends in .com, and have moved on to more promising new

buzzwords like "wireless."

But the metrics fly in the face of conventional wisdom. Internet use is up in

terms of real hours spent online and the number of people getting new accounts

e\~ery day. More surprisingly, although countless dot.corns have gone under for

failure to meet their investors' demands, e-commerce is actually up, as well-more

than 30% up from 2001. More than 100 million Americans now buy goods and

services online.

The Internet is more capable now than it ever was of supporting the vast range

of individual, community, and commercial interests that hope to exploit the mas-

sive power of networking. Still, countless investors, analysts, and pundits have

fallen off the Internet bandwagon.

I say good riddance. The experts jumping ship today can't see the Internet as

anything other than an investment opportunity that has dried up. Sure, the

Internet made a lot of people money, but its real promise has always been much

greater than a few upward stock ticks. If we can look past the size of our 401 K

plans to the underlying strength of our fledgling networked society, all signs are

a-okay. The Internet has never been in better health.

Maybe this kind of optimism requires us to look at the Internet as less of an

investment opportunity than a new kind of life form. Take MIT's newly

announced web curriculum. The university has promised that, over the next ten
